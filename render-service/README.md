# @openmaic/render-service

Isolated MP4 render service for OpenMAIC's classroom video export (issue #866).

The main app compiles a classroom to a self-contained Hyperframes project ZIP
(`index.html` + `assets/` + vendored GSAP) entirely in the browser. This service
takes that ZIP and renders it to an MP4 with [`@hyperframes/producer`], which
drives headless Chromium (frame capture) + FFmpeg (encode). It runs in its own
Node 22 container because the producer needs Node ≥ 22, Chromium, and FFmpeg —
none of which belong in the Next.js runtime.

It is an **opt-in capability**: when the app has no `RENDER_SERVICE_URL`
configured, in-app export degrades to downloading the project ZIP for local CLI
rendering. Nothing here is required for the app to run.

## HTTP API

Rendering is asynchronous (a 10-minute video can take tens of minutes): submit,
poll, then download. Job ids are opaque.

| Method + path                 | Purpose                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `POST /render`                | multipart: `project` (the ZIP) + `fps`, `quality`, `format` fields → `202 { jobId }` |
| `POST /preview`               | JSON: persisted `scene`, stage context, and viewport → synchronous PNG               |
| `GET /render/:jobId`          | status/progress plus actual capture, worker, profile, and runtime metrics            |
| `GET /render/:jobId/download` | stream the MP4 (or `302` to a presigned URL) once `succeeded`                        |
| `DELETE /render/:jobId`       | cancel a queued/running job                                                          |
| `GET /health`                 | resource profile, observed runtime versions, and whether renders are being admitted |

`status` is one of `queued | running | succeeded | failed | cancelled`;
`progress` is `0..1`.

### Admission: 429s and `/health`

Admission rejections are machine-readable. `POST /render` answers `429` with a
JSON body `{ error, reason }` where `reason` is one of:

- `queue_full` — the deployment-wide cap `RENDER_MAX_QUEUE` (reserved + queued +
  running jobs) is exhausted; back off and retry.
- `per_identity_limit` — this client identity already holds
  `RENDER_MAX_JOBS_PER_USER` active renders.

`POST /preview` also answers `429` with `{ error, reason }`, where `reason` is
one of:

- `preview_queue_full` — `RENDER_PREVIEW_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` previews are already
  live (buffering or executing).
- `preview_per_user_limit` — this client identity already holds
  `RENDER_PREVIEW_MAX_PER_USER` previews.
- `capacity_busy` — the shared execution slot is occupied, including by a video
  render. Previews never queue for this slot; retry later.

`GET /health` reports `accepting: boolean` — whether the queue cap currently has
room for another **video render** — it reflects the render queue only, not
preview admission or execution-slot availability. Callers and load balancers
can shed traffic before probing with a real render. The flag is deliberately
aggregate-only: no queue depths or occupancy counts, and never any per-identity
data. Identity keys are client IPs when the service runs behind
`TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true`, so exposing the per-identity map would publish the
IP address of everyone currently rendering.

Previews share the service's single Chromium execution slot with video renders,
but never wait in the video queue. Once a preview has passed its body and
semantic checks, it renders immediately or fails with `capacity_busy`.

`/preview` requires fully self-contained scenes (inline code and data: URLs
only); network, blob:, and relative references are rejected. Slide media must
use `data:` URLs, and interactive scenes must contain embedded HTML whose
resource references are inline or `data:` URLs. Non-self-contained inputs fail
with `422` instead of returning a misleading PNG. Detection is best-effort:
some exotic external constructs (for example, `object data`, `track src`, and
CSS `@import`) may pass validation; self-contained scenes are the caller's
responsibility, and end-to-end fidelity for persisted scenes arrives with
caller-side preparation (tracked separately).

Chunk settings are profile-bounded: the standard profile allows at most one
producer worker per chunk and four concurrent chunks; low-memory allows one of
each. Values above the selected profile limit fail startup rather than
silently multiplying browser, FFmpeg, and temporary-disk usage.

Client identity for the per-user guard is taken from the `x-openmaic-client`
header, which the app's proxy sets. A client-supplied `userId` form field is
ignored. The app derives that header from `x-forwarded-for`/`x-real-ip` **only
when the operator sets `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true`** (and a real reverse proxy
overwrites those headers); otherwise all callers share one `direct` identity, so
the default directly-exposed Compose topology can't be gamed by spoofing
forwarding headers.

## Security / isolation

The uploaded archive is untrusted, so extraction is bounded _before_ any bytes
are decompressed (entry count, per-entry and total expanded size, and
compression ratio — see the limits above), guarding against ZIP bombs.
Extraction runs on fflate's worker (off the event loop) and is concurrency-capped
so admitted jobs can't stack the per-archive RAM ceiling.

The composition HTML is then executed in headless Chromium. Two boundaries keep
that untrusted page contained:

- **No inbound-to-app bridge.** The container's entrypoint installs an iptables
  egress lockdown (drop all outbound except loopback + replies on app-initiated
  connections), so Chromium can't open connections back to the app — even though
  they share the Compose network so the app can reach the service. This needs the
  container to run with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` (`cap_add: [NET_ADMIN]`, already set in
  the Compose file). With `RENDER_EGRESS_LOCKDOWN=true` (the default) the entrypoint
  **fails closed**: if the rules can't be applied (missing capability, backend
  mismatch) the container exits non-zero rather than start an unisolated service
  the app would still advertise as healthy. An operator who knowingly accepts an
  unisolated standalone setup opts out with `RENDER_EGRESS_LOCKDOWN=false`.
  `scripts/egress-smoke.sh <image>` asserts the boundary end-to-end (lockdown
  active, loopback works, a new outbound connection is blocked).
- **No internet.** In Compose the `render` network is `internal: true` (no host
  or internet gateway). The export ZIP bundles every asset (and GSAP) at build
  time, so the render needs no outbound at all.

**When running standalone, place the service on an isolated network yourself**
(and keep the egress lockdown on, or accept the risk with the toggle) — it needs
no outbound access.

### Residual risk

The injected CSP plus request interception close script, fetch/XHR, WebSocket,
image, frame and form egress from the untrusted documents. Two channels remain:

- **Top-level navigation on `/render`.** `location`, a `<meta http-equiv=refresh>`,
  `window.open` and `target=_top` can replace the top frame; CSP has no
  `navigate-to` directive, and the producer's browser exposes no request
  interception we can install. The service therefore relies on the container's
  egress lockdown: with `RENDER_EGRESS_LOCKDOWN=false`, a rendered page can
  navigate to any reachable address and the result appears in the output video.
  Do not run standalone with the lockdown disabled.
- **Declarative subresources inside a framed SVG/XHTML.** Sanitizing removes
  script and event handlers, but a surviving `<image href>` (or CSS `url()`)
  can still load a subresource through a framed document that has no CSP of its
  own. The lockdown is what blocks that egress in supported deployments.

## Run

### Docker (recommended)

The root `docker-compose.yml` wires this service under the `video-export`
profile and points the app at it:

```bash
docker compose --profile video-export up --build
```

### Standalone (development)

Requires Node 22, Chromium's old headless shell, and FFmpeg on `PATH`. The
standard profile checks for 8 GiB of available host/cgroup memory before
listening:

```bash
cd render-service
npm install
PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=$(which chromium-headless-shell) \
PRODUCER_HEADLESS_SHELL_PATH=$(which chromium-headless-shell) \
RENDER_RESOURCE_PROFILE=standard \
PRODUCER_PUPPETEER_PROTOCOL_TIMEOUT_MS=900000 \
HF_STATIC_DEDUP=false \
npm start
```

## Resource profiles

The default `standard` CPU profile is the intended 1080p / 30 fps / standard
quality path: it prefers BeginFrame, while allowing producer to select screenshot
for compatibility-sensitive compositions such as iframe GenUI. Producer workers
are fixed at one, and the service admits one render plus one archive extraction
at a time. It requires at least 8 GiB of host/cgroup memory and an existing
headless shell so ordinary compositions remain BeginFrame-eligible. No host GPU
is required or requested; Chromium uses its software/SwiftShader selector.

Use the safe `low-memory` profile only when BeginFrame latency is less important
than a smaller memory ceiling. It fixes screenshot capture, one worker, one
render, and one extraction, and requires at least 4 GiB:

```bash
RENDER_RESOURCE_PROFILE=low-memory \
RENDER_SERVICE_MEMORY_LIMIT=4g \
docker compose --profile video-export up --build
```

Both `/health` and `GET /render/:jobId` make the selection observable. Health
reports the capture policy, requested mode, worker/concurrency bounds, minimum
memory, and observed Node, producer, Chromium, and FFmpeg versions. A completed
job reports requested versus actual capture mode and worker count with the same
version record, so a standard-profile screenshot fallback remains explicit.

The previous fixed 720p short-sample comparison that motivated these profiles was:

| Capture path | Workers | Result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| screenshot | 1 | 28.7 s baseline |
| BeginFrame | 1 | 16.3 s, about 43% faster |
| BeginFrame | 2 | only a small improvement beyond one worker |
| BeginFrame | 4 | no improvement on four vCPU; higher resource pressure |

These measurements justify the one-worker standard, not a general latency SLA.
The full 1080p sample took 696.9 s with one worker, with capture about 75.5% and
encode about 20.6% of runtime. Four-worker 1080p/4K and multi-job profiles remain
unsupported until their combined correctness and memory bounds are validated.

Output parity must be verified separately for each validated profile before
claiming parity acceptance.

## Scalability

The service is built with three swap points so it can move from a single OSS host
to a horizontally-scaled demo deployment without changing the HTTP contract or
the app:

- **`RenderExecutor`** (`src/render-executor.ts`) — `InProcessExecutor` adapts
  the current HyperFrames producer to stable progress, cancellation, deadline,
  failure, and performance types. A bounded local or remote executor can replace
  it without changing `RenderCoordinator` or the routes.
- **`JobStore`** (`src/job-store.ts`) — Part A ships `InMemoryJobStore`. A
  `RedisJobStore` implementing the same interface lets any replica serve poll /
  download requests.
- **`ArtifactStore`** (`src/artifact-store.ts`) — Part A ships
  `LocalDiskArtifactStore` (streams through the app proxy). An `S3ArtifactStore`
  whose `locate` returns a presigned URL makes the download route `302` the
  browser straight to object storage, bypassing the proxy.

`RenderCoordinator` owns admission, queueing, job state, artifact registration,
and cleanup while depending only on those three interfaces.

The opt-in local chunk executor uses `@hyperframes/producer/distributed` without
adding a queue or changing the HTTP contract. It freezes the producer plan and
runtime versions, bounds chunk fan-out and nested producer workers, verifies
chunk bytes and sidecar hashes before ordered assembly, and reuses only a valid
result for an idempotent retry. The default remains the in-process executor.
