#
# The service renders UNTRUSTED, uploaded HTML in Chromium. The export ZIP is
# fully self-contained (all assets + vendored GSAP are bundled at build time and
# served to Chromium over loopback), so the render needs ZERO outbound network.
# We enforce that here: block all egress except loopback and replies on already
# established (app-initiated) connections. This is the boundary that stops the
# untrusted page from initiating connections back to the app (e.g. the compose
# `openmaic` service) or anywhere else, even though both share a Docker network.
#
# Requires the container to start as root with CAP_NET_ADMIN (compose:
# `cap_add: [NET_ADMIN]`). We install the rules as root, then drop to the
# unprivileged `render` user for the Node process.
#
# FAIL CLOSED: when the lockdown is requested (RENDER_EGRESS_LOCKDOWN=true, the
# default) but cannot be installed, we EXIT non-zero rather than start an
# unisolated service that /health would still report as healthy — the app would
# otherwise advertise MP4 rendering while Chromium could reach the app. An
# operator who knowingly accepts an unisolated standalone setup must opt out
# explicitly with RENDER_EGRESS_LOCKDOWN=false.
