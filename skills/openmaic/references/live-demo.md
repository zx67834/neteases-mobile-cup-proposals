# Live Demo Mode

The OpenMAIC Live Demo (open.maic.chat) is the cloud edition — the version officially deployed and hosted by the OpenMAIC team, so no local setup is required. Use this when the user has an access code from open.maic.chat and wants to skip local setup.

## Access Code Setup

1. Read `accessCode` from skill config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `skills.entries.openmaic.config.accessCode`).
2. If found, use it directly. Do not ask the user to paste the code into chat.
3. If not found, tell the user how to get an access code and where to put it:
   - Get your access code: sign in at https://open.maic.chat, click your account in the top-right corner, open "访问码设置" (access code settings), and generate a code (starts with `sk-`).
   - Add it to the config file: edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and set `skills.entries.openmaic.config.accessCode` to your access code.
   Wait for the user to confirm before continuing. Do not ask them to paste the code in chat.
4. Verify connectivity: `GET https://open.maic.chat/api/health` with `Authorization: Bearer <access-code>`
   - On success: confirm connection and proceed to generation.
   - On failure (401): access code is invalid, ask the user to check or regenerate at open.maic.chat and update the config file.
   - On failure (network): suggest checking network or trying local mode.

## Generating a Classroom

Follow the same generation flow as [generate-flow.md](generate-flow.md) with these differences:

- **Base URL**: `https://open.maic.chat` (hardcoded, not configurable)
- **Authorization**: Include header `Authorization: Bearer <access-code>` on all API requests
- **Classroom URL**: `https://open.maic.chat/classroom/{id}`

### Feature Detection in Live Demo Mode

Before generating, query `GET https://open.maic.chat/api/health` (with auth header) to check `capabilities`. Automatically include optional feature flags (`enableWebSearch`, `enableImageGeneration`, etc.) based on what the server supports. Do not send new fields if the server does not return `capabilities` (older version). This ensures forward compatibility — the Live Demo instance may update on a different schedule than the local codebase.

## Quota

- 10 generations per day, independent of web UI quota
- If generation returns 403 with `Daily quota exhausted`, inform the user of the daily limit and that it resets at midnight.

## Error Handling

| HTTP Status | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| 401 | Invalid access code | Ask user to check their code or generate a new one at open.maic.chat |
| 403 | Quota exhausted | Inform daily limit (10), suggest trying tomorrow |
| 500 | Server error | Suggest retrying later or switching to local mode |
