# Generate Flow

## Preconditions

- Repo path is confirmed
- Startup mode has been chosen
- OpenMAIC is healthy at the selected `url`
- Provider keys are configured

> **Live Demo mode**: If using the OpenMAIC Live Demo (open.maic.chat), all
> preconditions (repo, startup, provider keys) are already satisfied.
> Include `Authorization: Bearer <access-code>` header on all requests below.
> See [live-demo.md](live-demo.md) for details.

## Requirement-Only Generation

If the user has already clearly asked to generate the classroom and the preconditions are satisfied, submit the generation job immediately. Do not ask for a second confirmation just before calling `/api/generate-classroom`.

Submit the job with:

```text
POST {url}/api/generate-classroom
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "requirement": "Create an introductory classroom on quantum mechanics for high school students"
}
```

Only send supported content fields:

- `requirement` (required)
- optional `pdfContent` object with the required shape `{ "text": string, "images": string[] }`; malformed values are rejected with `400 INVALID_REQUEST`
- optional `language` (`"zh-CN"` | `"en-US"`, defaults to `"zh-CN"`) — any other value silently falls back to `"zh-CN"`
- optional `enableWebSearch` (boolean) — include web search context in outline generation
- optional `enableImageGeneration` (boolean) — allow image generation metadata in outlines
- optional `enableVideoGeneration` (boolean) — allow video generation metadata in outlines
- optional `enableTTS` (boolean) — enable server-side TTS audio generation for speech actions
- optional `agentMode` (`"default"` | `"generate"`) — controls agent profile strategy:
  - `"default"` (or omitted): uses built-in default agents
  - `"generate"`: uses LLM to generate custom agent profiles tailored to the course content

All optional boolean fields default to `false` when omitted. Omitting them preserves backward compatibility.

### Feature Detection

Before sending optional feature flags, query `GET {url}/api/health` and check the `capabilities` object:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "...",
  "capabilities": {
    "webSearch": true,
    "imageGeneration": false,
    "videoGeneration": false,
    "tts": true
  }
}
```

Only set a feature flag to `true` if the corresponding capability is `true`. If the server does not return `capabilities` (older version), do not send the new fields.

Do not rely on request-time model or provider override parameters.

Treat the `POST` response as job submission only. Expect fields such as:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "jobId": "abc123",
  "status": "queued",
  "step": "queued",
  "pollUrl": "http://localhost:3000/api/generate-classroom/abc123",
  "pollIntervalMs": 5000
}
```

## PDF-Based Generation

1. Resolve the absolute path to the PDF.
2. Confirm before reading the file.
3. Parse the PDF first:

```text
POST {url}/api/parse-pdf
```

4. Then send `requirement` plus `pdfContent` to:

```text
POST {url}/api/generate-classroom
```

Use this request shape:

```json
{
  "requirement": "Create a classroom from this PDF",
  "pdfContent": {
    "text": "Parsed PDF text...",
    "images": []
  }
}
```

Both `pdfContent.text` and `pdfContent.images` are required when `pdfContent` is present. `text` must be a string and every entry in `images` must be a string. The current generation pipeline consumes `pdfContent.text`; `images` is still part of the API contract and is counted in generation job metadata.

## Polling Loop

After the job is submitted:

1. Save `jobId`, `pollUrl`, and `pollIntervalMs`.
2. Do not submit another generation job while this one is still `queued` or `running`.
3. Poll:

```text
GET {pollUrl}
```

4. Prefer a conservative polling cadence of about 60 seconds between polls for classroom generation jobs, even if `pollIntervalMs` is shorter.
5. Treat `queued` and `running` as in-progress states.
6. Stop only when `status` becomes `succeeded` or `failed`.

### Reliability Rules

- Never restart the job just because a poll request fails once.
- If a poll request returns a transient network error or `5xx`, wait about 60 seconds and retry the same `pollUrl`.
- If the job is still running after many polls, tell the user it is still in progress and continue polling instead of resubmitting.
- Prefer fewer poll attempts over aggressive polling. Long-running jobs are more likely to survive agent-loop limits if the tool-call cadence stays low.
- Within a single agent turn, cap active polling to about 10 minutes. If the job is still not finished, tell the user it is still running and include the `jobId` and `pollUrl` so a later turn can continue checking without resubmitting.
- Report progress to the user only when `status`, `step`, or visible progress meaningfully changes. Do not spam every poll result.
- Do not try to recover from auth, provider, model, or base URL errors by changing request parameters. Tell the user to fix OpenMAIC server-side config and retry only after they confirm.
- On `failed`, surface the server error and include the `jobId`.
- On `succeeded`, use `result.classroomId` and `result.url` from the final poll response.

## If The Loop Ends First

If the job is still running when you stop active polling for this turn, tell the user that the classroom generation is still running in the background and invite them to come back a little later to continue checking the same job.

Use natural phrasing such as:

```text
The classroom generation is still running in the background.
Job ID: abc123

Check back with me in a little while and I can continue tracking this same job without starting over.
```

## What To Return

Return the generated classroom ID plus a directly clickable classroom URL.

Output the URL as a raw absolute URL on its own line.

Do not wrap the URL in:

- bold markers such as `**...**`
- markdown links such as `[title](url)`
- code formatting such as `` `...` ``
- angle brackets such as `<...>`
- markdown tables

Use a compact format like:

```text
Classroom ID: Uyh82Y32ZK
Classroom URL:
http://localhost:3001/classroom/Uyh82Y32ZK
```

If the job fails, return the job ID plus the server error.

If generation fails, surface the server error directly instead of paraphrasing it away.

If the error suggests a provider or model configuration problem, explicitly tell the user to update `.env.local` or `server-providers.yml` instead of attempting a runtime override.

## Confirmation Requirements

- Ask before reading a local PDF.
- Do not ask for a second confirmation before the generation request if the user has already clearly asked you to generate the classroom.
