description: The baseline method for building ONE stage — a single classroom — with this runtime. Covers how the plan is settled in conversation, the order the generation tools are called in, how the classroom roster is written, when narration has to be re-synthesized, and what must be true before a stage is called done. Load this before generating or rebuilding any stage from scratch, whatever its subject; it is the floor the topic skills build on, not an alternative to them.

# Building one stage

A stage is one classroom: one settled plan, one roster, one deck of pages. This
is how a stage is built here, whatever its subject.

A topic skill (`deep-interactive`, `vocational`, `deep-research`,
`teacher-style-clone`, …) may shape what the stage contains — its structure, its
page types, how scenes are named — and where one is active its instructions win
on those questions. The sequence below is not one of those questions: it is the
same under every topic skill. Read this one first, then the topic skill.

Nothing here applies to a stage that already has pages. A stage with persisted
pages is edited, not built (see `pro-editing`).

## The build sequence

Build a NEW stage only when there are no persisted pages yet. Then, in this
order:

1. **Plan the stage in the conversation.** Propose the page plan yourself —
   each page with its `title`, `type` (`slide` / `quiz` / `interactive` /
   `pbl`) and `brief` (this page's teaching intent and content outline, the
   same information a planned outline slot used to carry) — in page order.
   Settle the plan with the user through `ask_user` before creating anything:
   there is no outline tool to plan with, so the plan is your words and their
   sign-off. A topic skill's structural constraints are a diagnostic the
   runtime checks against the real stage after each page; you decide how to
   act on it.
2. **`create_stage`** with the settled course title (pass the series folder's
   `folderId` when the stage is part of a series, so it is filed in the same
   call). From here on, pass the returned stageId to every stage tool.
3. **`set_roster`**, before any page is generated. Write the classroom the
   user settled: exactly one teacher, at least two agents in total, each with
   a concrete persona (2-3 sentences on personality and teaching/learning
   style, in the stage language) and a voice — call `list_voices` first and
   bind one of the returned `providerId::voiceId` pairs, or the exact pair
   `register_voice` returned for a cloned voice; omit the binding when no
   usable voice exists. Every page's content
   and narration is written for the roster that exists when the page is
   generated, so a roster settled late is a roster half the stage never saw.
4. **`generate_scene` for EACH settled page, in ascending order** — one
   page per call, never more. Pass the page's settled `title`, `type` and
   `brief` (plus `materialFacts` when the page's content comes from attached
   material); no planned outline is needed. A `pbl` page is generated the same
   way and lands as a full PBL project (`projectV2`) from its brief; a failed
   generation reports an error and writes nothing. Each call is the durable
   checkpoint for its page: the page survives an interruption only once the
   call has returned.
5. **`list_scenes`** to verify every page you settled is actually persisted.

None of the planning steps is a place to stop: a turn ends when a page actually
landed, when `ask_user` is waiting on the user, or when the stage is done by the
check below. Reporting what you have planned, imported or confirmed leaves the
user holding an empty deck.

## When `generate_scene` fails

Track generation attempts by `stageId + order`. Changing the title or brief,
or generating another page in between, does not reset the attempt.

- For `prompt-unavailable` or another deterministic failure, do not repeat the
  same call.
- For `invalid-model-output`, change the brief without changing the settled
  teaching intent, then retry once. Retry once for a clearly transient provider
  failure too.
- If that retry fails, do not call `generate_scene` again for that target during
  this run. Leave the page unwritten, continue with later pages in the same
  stage, and name the gap when wrapping up. Do not call `ask_user` after every
  failed page or silently drop the page from the settled plan.

Use `list_scenes` to reconcile persisted pages with the settled plan. A stage
with a missing page can be wrapped up after later pages are built, but it is not
done; name each gap and its latest failure instead of claiming completion.

## Narration audio follows narration text

When a page's narration is written or reworded with `patch_stage` on an
`/actions/...` JSON Pointer, call `generate_tts` on that page. A reworded speech line has
no audio until the page is re-synthesized, so narration text that was changed
and not re-synthesized ships as a silent page.

## Before you call the stage done

Every settled page has to be persisted — a stage is done when the deck is
complete, not when it is planned or half built.

Every speech action must have audio. `read_stage` each page at
`path:/scenes/<order|id>` with `detail:"source"`, check the
`audioId` field on its speech actions, and call `generate_tts` on any page that
is missing it. Read what those actions say while you are there: narration that
talks about material this stage does not teach is a defect, whatever its audio
status. Only then is the stage finished.

When every settled page is persisted, say so to the user in one or two
sentences.
