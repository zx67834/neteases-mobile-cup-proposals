## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-15

A security release: access-code tokens now expire and verification is throttled behind a trusted proxy, the render service applies a network policy to the untrusted HTML it renders, audio provider requests validate redirects and pin their connections, and Next.js is upgraded to patch a critical RCE. It also carries the fixes and features merged since 1.0.2.

### Security

- Access-code verification tokens (`timestamp.HMAC`) never expired because neither verifier checked the timestamp, and `POST /api/access-code/verify` had no throttling. Both verifiers now enforce a 7-day server-side lifetime and reject non-canonical signatures, and verification is rate-limited per client when `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` (with a warning to use a long random `ACCESS_CODE` when it is short) [GHSA-qpmr-534w-hhpg](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/security/advisories/GHSA-qpmr-534w-hhpg) (reported by @CaptBoykin) [#1513](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1513)
- The render service ran caller-supplied HTML in headless Chromium without the packager's Content-Security-Policy on the `/preview` and `/render` paths, so inline script could reach loopback and internal addresses and, on `/render`, paint the response into the returned MP4. Both paths now inject a first-parsed CSP, the preview frame is additionally guarded by request interception, and framed same-origin `.svg`/`.xhtml` documents are sanitized [GHSA-vqq3-22q7-289w](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/security/advisories/GHSA-vqq3-22q7-289w) (reported by @CaptBoykin) [#1512](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1512)
- Audio provider requests (TTS, ASR, voice registration and voice cloning) validated a client-supplied base URL once and then followed redirects and re-resolved DNS unvalidated, so a redirect or a rebinding answer could reach an internal address. These requests now validate every redirect hop and connect only to the addresses the guard validated, on every hop [GHSA-9p8q-rcmg-pmjw](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/security/advisories/GHSA-9p8q-rcmg-pmjw) (reported by @CaptBoykin) [#1514](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1514)
- Upgrade Next.js from 16.2.11 to 16.3.3, which patches an unauthenticated remote code execution on Windows-hosted servers ([GHSA-p293-qw3h-jr36](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-p293-qw3h-jr36) / CVE-2026-75604) [#1503](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1503)

### Features

- Storage: the server owns the asset entry lifecycle and releases assets on course deletion (the #1007 amendment) [#1472](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1472) [#1473](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1473)
- Skills: add an inquiry-based exercise-class teaching skill grounded in the zone of proximal development [#1382](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1382)

### Bug Fixes

- Importer: resolve embedded PPTX videos when the legacy link points at NULL, and upload video posters through the configured callback (`@openmaic/importer` 0.2.1) [#1507](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1507)
- Storage: keep jsonb writes valid when model output contains NUL or lone surrogates [#1499](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1499); allow one owner material to be bound to multiple sessions [#1500](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1500)
- Classroom: render a transient server error as a retryable state instead of the terminal "course does not exist" card, on both the pane and the standalone route [#1485](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1485)
- Upload: resolve the generic Office MIME (`application/vnd.ms-office`) via the filename extension [#1498](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1498)
- Settings: maintain the ASR language state invariant on provider selection [#1443](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1443)
- TTS: treat a custom provider's Add-dialog default base URL as a configured credential path so generation narration is not skipped [#1482](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1482)
- Export: tolerate malformed authored CSS in classroom exports instead of dropping later assets [#1422](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1422)
- Render service: preserve plan audio during chunk assembly [#1358](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1358)
- Docker: enable the Pro workbench flag in Docker builds and allow a non-TLS localhost cookie [#1484](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1484)

### Other Changes

- Docs: document the deployment assumptions and pre-report checks in the security policy [#1511](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1511)
- Tests: isolate the image URL-guard test environment so it no longer inherits the generic OpenAI fallback [#1476](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1476)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-14

A security release that closes a cloud-metadata SSRF gap, a DNS-rebinding bypass
on media proxying, and a classroom overwrite, and tightens two request paths —
read the Breaking Changes section first.

### Security

- `/api/proxy-media` and the outbound URL guard accepted the Alibaba Cloud
  instance-metadata address `100.100.100.200` because the metadata denylist was
  not applied before an IP literal was accepted. The guard now checks metadata
  hostnames and addresses — including mapped and transition encodings — before
  the literal and local-network branches, in every environment and regardless of
  `ALLOW_LOCAL_NETWORKS`
  [GHSA-6xff-rgjg-v33f](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/security/advisories/GHSA-6xff-rgjg-v33f) (reported by @lihua666a-cell)
- `/api/proxy-media` validated a hostname and then let `fetch()` resolve it
  again at connect time, so a name whose answer changed between the two lookups
  could reach an internal address (DNS rebinding). The proxy now connects only
  to the addresses the guard validated, on every redirect hop, through a shared
  pinned dispatcher
  [GHSA-23xq-m3mm-3j49](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/security/advisories/GHSA-23xq-m3mm-3j49) (reported by @ry2811)
- `POST /api/classroom` accepted a caller-chosen classroom id and renamed a
  temporary file over an existing classroom, replacing its content. Ids are now
  server-generated and classroom files are created exclusively, with a bounded
  retry and a 409 on collision
  [GHSA-87m4-6c66-pc68](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/security/advisories/GHSA-87m4-6c66-pc68) (reported by @ry2811)
- `POST /api/generate/tts` now inspects a 200 response before storing or billing
  it: HTML, JSON and other non-audio bodies are rejected, and a URL embedded in
  a JSON envelope is never followed [#1405](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1405)

### Breaking Changes

- `POST /api/classroom` no longer honours a client-supplied `stage.id`; the `id` in the response is the classroom's id [#1489](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1489)
- The outbound URL guard now refuses IANA reserved, documentation, multicast and broadcast ranges (`240.0.0.0/4`, `198.18.0.0/15`, `192.0.2.0/24`, `2001:db8::/32`, …) at both the URL and the connection layer, regardless of `ALLOW_LOCAL_NETWORKS`. CGNAT `100.64.0.0/10` (Tailscale and similar overlays) is blocked by default and allowed with `ALLOW_LOCAL_NETWORKS=true`, like private ranges [#1488](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1488)

### Features

- Playback: the global Reference courseware entry now grounds HTML-backed GenUI and Interactive scenes on one source-authored component — resolved again on the host against the request-start scene snapshot, sanitized and bounded, and shared with the Director and both child runtimes — behind the default-off `NEXT_PUBLIC_COURSEWARE_REFERENCE_ENABLED` build-time gate [#1281](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1281)
- Export: the export dialog checks render queue availability before compiling; a service that reports itself busy disables MP4 with a localized hint and a manual recheck, while ZIP and subtitle downloads stay available [#1455](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1455)
- Media: under server-backed persistence, generated media is written through the asset pool first and the allocated id is persisted into the document, so a reload regenerates nothing and other browsers resolve the same bytes [#1392](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1392)
- Providers: add GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.3-Flash, and make the GLM thinking adapter degrade a disabled request to the lightest effort for always-thinking models [#1401](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1401)
- Render service: emit one JSON lifecycle event per render and preview transition — submission, start with `queueWaitMs`, finish with its outcome and duration, admission rejection, and preview request — carrying only bounded, low-cardinality fields [#1397](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1397)

### Bug Fixes

- TTS: prepare the next discussion segment while the current clip plays, so synthesis latency overlaps playback while audio stays strictly ordered [#1435](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1435)
- Export: keep one in-memory compiled ZIP so an unchanged retry after a 429 submits the same result instead of recompiling [#1456](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1456)
- AI runtime: let non-streaming LLM calls outlive undici's 300 s headers timeout through a shared dispatcher with a 15-minute limit [#1404](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1404); share one process-local thinking context across Next.js bundle evaluations [#1378](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1378)
- Importer: convert Equation 3.0 and MathType OLE formulas to LaTeX through MTEF v3 with degrade telemetry, and fix the non-transparent formula placeholder [#1411](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1411); stop PPTX import from hanging in non-browser environments by bounding image loading and EMF/PDF rasterization [#1424](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1424)
- Quiz: resolve AI answer keys to option values before grading, failing closed when a key matches no option or several [#1328](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1328)
- Renderer: lazy-load the optional ECharts runtime, share one loading promise and wait for chart readiness during slide PNG export [#1420](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1420)
- Render service: keep preview browser evaluation self-contained so `tsx`'s `__name` helper never reaches Chromium [#1421](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1421); enforce the chunk worker cap and report the worker count actually observed [#1359](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1359)
- Materials: sanitize the owner id in the byte-store key so uploads work on Windows [#1426](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1426)
- Settings: read `data.error` for image and video provider test results instead of rendering `failed: undefined` [#1459](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1459)
- Classroom: adapt the completion page to short viewports instead of clipping its content above the scroll origin [#1461](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1461)
- Build: include the libvips native libraries in standalone tracing so sharp loads at boot [#1407](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1407)

### Other Changes

- CI: add an opt-in issue triage agent that analyzes read-only by default and publishes only on an explicit run [#1439](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1439)
- Docs: state the advisory severity and CVE process in the security policy [#1417](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1417)
- Tests: cover preview callbacks across the `tsx`/browser boundary [#1454](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1454); make the material search budget test deterministic through an injectable clock [#1453](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1453)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-06

A security and stability release. Everyone running 1.0.0 should upgrade; read the
Breaking Changes section first, as this release tightens two defaults.

### Security

- Classroom persistence rejected a stage id that escaped the classrooms directory
  only on the read path. The write path now applies the same allowlist, and the
  storage layer asserts a resolved classroom file stays inside `CLASSROOMS_DIR`
  [GHSA-p2wh-m28m-c5xw](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/security/advisories/GHSA-p2wh-m28m-c5xw) (reported by @skeletonsec)
- Stored slide HTML is now restricted to the formatting vocabulary the renderer
  produces, sanitized at the classroom persistence boundary on both write and read,
  with a separate policy for KaTeX snapshots so formulas are not flattened
  [GHSA-7rhf-2798-mvcj](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/security/advisories/GHSA-7rhf-2798-mvcj) (reported by @skeletonsec)
- The outbound URL guard ran only under `NODE_ENV=production`; it now runs at every
  call site in every environment, and a repository-scanning test fails if a gated
  call site reappears
  [GHSA-9m7h-vh2h-rc3w](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/security/advisories/GHSA-9m7h-vh2h-rc3w) (reported by @uziii2208)
- Provider requests now re-validate every redirect hop through a shared transport
  and drop credential headers on a cross-origin hop, the way the platform fetch does
  [GHSA-725p-44hx-v52c](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/security/advisories/GHSA-725p-44hx-v52c) (reported by @skeletonsec)
- The development persistence authenticator is refused under `NODE_ENV=production`
  unless an explicit opt-in is set; it provides no user isolation and was never
  meant to serve production traffic
- Bump next, js-yaml, undici, nanoid, lodash and sharp for disclosed advisories [#1357](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1357)
- Bound skill zip inflation instead of trusting the declared uncompressed size [#1374](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1374), and bound `import_pptx` parsing with a size cap and timeout [#1269](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1269)

### Breaking Changes

- Node: the minimum supported runtime is now 22.19.0, up from 20.9.0 [#1337](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1337)
- The outbound URL guard now runs in every environment, not only production builds. A client-supplied provider base URL pointing at a loopback or private address — a local Ollama or Lemonade endpoint entered in Settings, for example — is rejected unless `ALLOW_LOCAL_NETWORKS=true` is set. Production deployments already behaved this way; development builds did not
- Redirect hops are re-validated for every provider, including server-managed ones. An internal gateway that answers a redirect to a private address needs `ALLOW_LOCAL_NETWORKS=true`
- The development persistence authenticator no longer serves traffic under `NODE_ENV=production`. A deployment that intentionally runs it on a trusted network must set `PERSISTENCE_ALLOW_INSECURE_DEV_AUTH=true`
- `POST /api/classroom` now rejects a payload whose scenes do not satisfy the slide DSL, and a stage id outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`

### Features

- Agent: add a fact-check skill [#1274](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1274); let `generate_scene` pass `widgetType` and `widgetOutline` for interactive pages [#1259](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1259); make `generate_video` asynchronous with a placeholder reference [#1267](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1267)

- Generation: assign unique IDs per media request [#1368](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1368); load micropip before generated imports [#1282](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1282); keep diagram node position off the hover transform [#1339](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1339); normalize GPT Image 2 generation sizes [#1346](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1346)
- Providers and media: apply server-pinned models for image and video providers [#1298](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1298); bypass the AI SDK for custom ASR providers so extra response fields survive [#1283](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1283); turn TTS and media generation on from the Settings page [#1311](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/1311)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-02

### Features

- **MAIC Editor (v0) — slide editing surface** — A new **Pro Mode** toggle turns any generated slide into an editable canvas: select and edit text, insert text boxes and images, navigate and reorder slides from a thumbnail rail, with history-aware undo/redo. This is the first surface of the broader MAIC Editor framework (gated behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIC_EDITOR_ENABLED`) [#615](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/615)
- **Editable outline before generation** — The streaming course outline now morphs into an inline editor: review, edit, reorder, and add or delete scenes and bullet points, then confirm to generate the full course — so you catch structure problems before spending a full generation [#558](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/558)
- **Offline-ready classroom export** — Exported teaching resource packs and classroom ZIPs now inline external assets so interactive pages open fully offline, even when copied to another machine [#613](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/613)
- Add Claude Opus 4.8 and MiniMax M3 to the default model registry [#635](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/635)

### Bug Fixes

- **Server-configured providers are now admin-managed** — providers set via server environment can no longer be overridden by client settings, preventing base-URL/key tampering on shared deployments [#624](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/624); fixes server API-key fallback when the client echoes the provider base URL [#533](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/533) (by @LooThao); auto-selects the server LLM model [#577](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/577) (by @xuruiray); and enforces a "usable provider ⇒ concrete model" invariant [#581](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/581)
- Keep interactive scenes alive across remounts with an iframe keep-alive pool, so interactive content no longer reloads when navigating [#629](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/629)

- Skip shapes with malformed SVG paths instead of aborting the whole PPTX export [#505](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/505); prevent memory leaks and silent export failures [#552](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/552) (by @arnow117)
- Add defensive checks in ChartElement to prevent crashes on malformed chart data [#588](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/588) (by @tongshu2023)

- Fix the commercial licensing contact email [#604](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/604) (by @DHQ1204)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-26

### Features

- **[VoxCPM2](https://github.com/OpenBMB/VoxCPM) TTS provider with voice cloning** — OpenMAIC adapts to user-managed VoxCPM backends (vLLM-Omni, Nano-VLLM, official Python API). Clone any voice from a reference audio clip you upload or record in the browser, or let Auto Voice generate a fitting voice from each agent's persona at synthesis time. Voice profiles are stored locally to keep the serverless setup model. The Agent Bar exposes a searchable, previewable voice picker that draws from the global VoxCPM voice pool [#496](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/496)
- **Per-model thinking configuration** — First-class metadata for each model's reasoning capability (effort levels, on/off toggle, adjustable budget, or fixed thinking) flows through chat and all generation paths and is mapped to the right provider-specific request fields (Anthropic `thinking`, OpenAI `reasoning`, etc.). The model selector becomes a unified provider/model/thinking popover with compact search and a much smaller toolbar footprint [#494](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/494)
- **End-of-course completion page with persistent quiz state** — When the outline is fully materialized, students see a course-complete view with quiz score card, scene-type stat cards, and a (motion-respecting) confetti celebration. Quiz answers persist on submit and grading results persist on completion, so navigating away and back restores the reviewing state with AI feedback intact instead of resetting [#484](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/484)
- Add latest released models including [GPT-5.5](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/487), DeepSeek-V4 (`-pro`, `-flash`), Xiaomi [MiMo](https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo) (`mimo-v2.5-pro`, `mimo-v2.5`), Tencent [Hy3](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan), and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) as a multi-provider gateway [#481](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/481) [#487](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/487)
- Add OpenAI image generation (GPT-Image-2) as a media provider [#481](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/481)
- Refresh built-in model registries across Anthropic, DeepSeek, Kimi, Qwen, MiniMax, Grok, OpenAI, GLM, SiliconFlow, and Ollama; persisted local settings now rehydrate in registry order so newly curated lists appear consistent without clearing state [#481](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/481)
- Add inline search for recent classrooms on the home page with deferred filtering by name and description, keyboard-driven open/clear/collapse [#476](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/476)
- Add Deep-Interactive badge on classroom thumbnails for sessions generated with Interactive Mode [#478](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/478)
- Replace always-included media instruction blocks in generation prompts with conditional snippet includes gated on `imageEnabled` / `videoEnabled` — disabled capabilities are removed from the prompt entirely instead of relying on negative-override directives the model often ignored [#490](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/490) (by @YizukiAme)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix language drift between outline and scene generation by unifying the languageDirective across the pipeline so the same target language flows from outline planning through every per-scene call [#474](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/474)

### Other Changes

- Refactor whiteboard role prompts to file-based markdown templates and add a geometry-conflict detector (overlap, line-through-bbox, canvas clipping) that surfaces problems back to the model. Eval (flash, repeat 3, gemini-3.1-pro scorer) shows overall quality 5.4 → 6.1 and overlap 6.3 → 8.1 from prompt + detector alone [#485](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/485)
- Migrate orchestration prompt builders (`buildStructuredPrompt`, `buildDirectorPrompt`, `buildPBLSystemPrompt`) from inline TS template literals to file-based markdown templates under `lib/prompts/`, sharing the loader infrastructure with the generation pipeline. `prompt-builder.ts` 890 → 314 lines; future content tweaks land as markdown edits [#459](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/459)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-20

### Features

- **Deep Interactive Mode** — Generate hands-on interactive scenes (3D visualization, simulation, game, mind map/diagram, online programming) with an AI teacher who operates the UI to guide students.
