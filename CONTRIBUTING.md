# Contributing to OpenMAIC

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenMAIC! This guide will help you get started and ensure a smooth collaboration.

## How to Contribute

| Contribution type | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| **Bug fix** | Open a PR directly (link the issue if one exists) |
| **Extending existing features** (e.g. adding a new model provider, new TTS engine) | Open a PR directly |
| **New feature or architecture change** | Start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/discussions) or ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/p8Pf2r3SaG) **before** opening a PR |
| **Design / UI change** | Discuss in a GitHub Discussion or Discord first — include mockups or screenshots |
| **Refactor-only PR** | Not accepted unless a maintainer explicitly requests it |
| **Documentation** | Open a PR directly |
| **Question** | Ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/p8Pf2r3SaG) |

## Claiming Issues

To avoid duplicate effort, please **comment on an issue** to claim it before you start working. A maintainer will assign you.

- If **no PR or meaningful update** (WIP commit, progress comment) appears within **1 day**, the issue may be reassigned to someone else.
- If you see an issue already assigned, reach out to the assignee first to coordinate — you may be able to collaborate or split the work.
- If you can no longer work on a claimed issue, please leave a comment so others can pick it up.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22.19.0
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (latest)
- A copy of `.env.local` — see [`.env.example`](.env.example) for reference

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC.git
cd OpenMAIC

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API keys

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature main
   ```
2. **Branch naming convention:**
   - `feat/` — new features or enhancements
   - `fix/` — bug fixes
   - `docs/` — documentation changes
3. Make your changes and **test locally**.
4. Run **all CI checks** before committing (see below).
5. Open a **Pull Request** against `main`.

### Environment Variable Changes

When adding or renaming an operator-facing environment variable, update
[`.env.example`](.env.example) in the same PR. Document whether it is optional,
its safe default or example value, and whether it is read at build time or
runtime. Variables used only by tests, CI, or internal development scripts do
not need to be added to the template, but their owning file or documentation
must make that limited scope clear.

## Before You Submit a PR

Run the following checks locally — CI will run them too, but catching issues early saves everyone time:

```bash
# 1. Format code
pnpm format

# 2. Lint (with auto-fix)
pnpm lint --fix

# 3. TypeScript type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

If formatting or lint auto-fixes produce changes, include them in your commit.

### Local Testing

Before marking a PR as **Ready for Review**, you **must**:

1. **Verify your goal** — confirm that the PR achieves what it set out to do (bug is fixed, feature works as expected, etc.)
2. **Regression test** — manually check that existing functionality is not broken by your changes (e.g. navigate key flows, verify related features still work)
3. **Run CI checks locally** (see above)

If you have not completed local verification, keep your PR in **Draft** status. Only move it to Ready for Review once you are confident it works and does not regress other features.

### PR Guidelines

- **Every PR must link to an issue** — use `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456` in the PR description. If no issue exists yet, create one first. PRs without a linked issue will not be reviewed.
- **Keep PRs focused** — one concern per PR; do not mix unrelated changes
- **Describe what and why** — fill out the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md)
- **Include screenshots** — for UI changes, show before/after
- **Ensure CI passes** before requesting review
- **All UI text must be internationalized (i18n)** — do not hardcode user-facing strings

## Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`, `style`

Examples:

```
feat(tts): add Azure TTS provider
fix(whiteboard): prevent canvas from resetting on window resize
docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md
```

## Changing a Published Package

Four packages under `packages/@openmaic/` are published to npm: `dsl`, `storage`, `renderer`, and `importer`. Anything that ships inside one of those tarballs is under version control in the literal sense — the version number on npm has to keep meaning "this exact source".

**If your PR changes a publishable file in one of those packages, bump that package's `version` in its `package.json` in the same PR.** CI enforces this, and without the bump you will see:

```
<package>: publishable package inputs changed but version did not increase
```

What counts as publishable: everything under the package directory except files that never reach the tarball, such as `docs/`, `test/`, and `vitest.config.ts`. Editing only those needs no bump. The exact set lives in `scripts/check-package-version-bumps.mjs`.

Choosing the number is a [semver](https://semver.org/) judgement, and it is yours to make rather than something CI can infer:

- **patch** — a fix that changes no documented behaviour
- **minor** — new behaviour that existing consumers can ignore
- **major** — anything an existing consumer must react to

For packages below `1.0.0`, a **minor** bump signals a breaking change and a **patch** bump signals a compatible change, following common 0.x semver practice; the **major** rule applies from `1.0.0`.

Be deliberate with `@openmaic/dsl`. It is the contract the other packages and downstream deployments validate against, so a change that narrows what an existing document may contain is a breaking change even when the diff looks small.

You never publish anything yourself. Once your PR is merged, a version that is not yet on the registry is released automatically, and a `@openmaic/<name>@<version>` tag is written afterwards to record it. That tag is a marker, not a trigger: pushing one does not release anything.

## AI-Assisted PRs 🤖

PRs built with AI tools (Codex, Claude, Cursor, etc.) are welcome! We just ask for transparency and self-review:

- **Mark it** — note in the PR title or description that the PR is AI-assisted
- **AI-review your own code first** — before requesting maintainer review, run an AI code review (e.g. Claude, Codex, Copilot) on your changes and address the findings. This is **required** for AI-assisted PRs to avoid dumping large amounts of unreviewed generated code on maintainers.
- **You are responsible for what you submit** — understand the code, not just the prompt.

AI-assisted PRs are held to the same quality standard as any other PR. Community members are also encouraged to leave constructive feedback on any PR — peer review helps everyone improve.
