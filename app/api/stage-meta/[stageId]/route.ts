/**
 * GET /api/stage-meta/[stageId] — the per-viewer facts a document does not carry
 * (the reference's stage-meta sidecar, ported onto this branch's owner model).
 *
 * The document seam returns a DOCUMENT: stage + scenes + outline, and nothing
 * about who is asking. The classroom branches on exactly that — `isOwner`
 * decides read-only vs editable — so the split is explicit: the document
 * carries content, this sidecar carries tenancy, and the client fetches both
 * in parallel.
 *
 * ## Everything here is fail-closed on the tombstone
 *
 * `resolveStageAccess` answers `null` for a deleted course exactly as it does
 * for one that never existed, so a deleted course 404s here too. This endpoint
 * is unauthenticated-friendly (any visitor may ask about any id), so if it
 * leaked `{isPublic: true}` for a tombstoned course it would be a public oracle
 * for "this course used to exist".
 *
 * ## No `ownerId` in the response, ever
 *
 * `isOwner` is a boolean derived server-side. Returning the owner's identity
 * key would hand every visitor a stable cross-course identifier for the author.
