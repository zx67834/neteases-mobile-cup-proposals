const RUBRIC_PROMPT = `You are evaluating a classroom whiteboard screenshot from an AI teaching assistant. Score like a teacher reviewing their own board work for a student's benefit.

Context: This is a real-time teaching whiteboard, NOT a poster or infographic.
- Empty space is NORMAL and NOT a problem — teachers write in one area at a time.
- What matters: would a student be confused, misled, or unable to read the content?
- Ignore the small dark circle "N" in the corner — it is a page UI element, not whiteboard content.

Score each dimension from 1 to 10 (10 = perfect, 1 = broken):

1. readability — Can a student read every element easily?
   - Font size CONSISTENCY is critical: penalize heavily if some text is 2x+ larger than other text on the same board (e.g., one giant title + tiny formulas).
   - Are characters crisp? Any Chinese rendered as boxes or missing glyphs?
   - Penalize text styled like UI components (gray boxes, card backgrounds) that don't match handwritten whiteboard feel.

2. overlap — Are elements clear of each other, AND does new content respect existing content?
   - Penalize any occlusion (shapes over text, text stacked on text, arrows piercing labels).
   - CRITICAL: penalize "writing over existing content" — if a new formula is placed directly on top of an existing table row when empty space was available nearby, that is a layout failure, not just overlap.
   - 10 = everything distinct; 1 = multiple elements unreadable due to occlusion.

3. rendering_correctness — Are formulas, shapes, and symbols drawn correctly?
   - LaTeX must render: raw source like "\\\\frac", "\\\\theta", or garbled chunks like "0ext", "Gsinheta", "heta" = major penalty.
   - Subscripts/superscripts must render: "G_x" shown as raw underscore (not Gₓ) = penalty.
   - Chinese inside LaTeX math mode (e.g., "口诀(当 a > 0 ext 时)") = penalty.
   - Diagram ACCURACY matters: a parabola drawn as V-shape straight lines, a circle drawn as ellipse-when-should-be-circle, an angle labeled wrong = penalty.
   - 10 = all math/shapes render correctly and match the concept; 1 = multiple broken renders OR fundamentally wrong diagrams.

4. content_completeness — Is the content whole, bounded, and annotated?
   - Edge clipping: any element cut off at canvas edge (formula missing its left character, table column cut, arrow head beyond edge) = major penalty.
   - Unexpected clearing: if previous turns' content has vanished in a later turn with no reason, penalize.
   - Bare diagrams with no labels (a circle with no annotation of what it represents) = penalty.
   - 10 = all content fully visible and annotated; 1 = significant content lost, truncated, or unlabeled.

5. layout_logic — Does the arrangement support teaching flow?
   - Related elements grouped (a diagram with its labels/formulas together)?
   - Natural reading order for the concept (cause → effect, equation → graph → solution)?
   - Spatial planning: does new content go to sensibly-chosen empty areas rather than crammed near or over existing elements?

overall: 1–10 holistic teaching-quality score. Weight overlap and rendering_correctness more heavily since they directly block comprehension.

issues: 1-5 short concrete problem descriptions a teacher would call out.
