/**
 * The upgrade path: a database that already holds documents and entries, and
 * has never had a reference writer on it.
 *
 * The collector's entry level refuses to run until something has declared that
 * this database's writers maintain references, and until it runs, the one-time
 * backfill does not either. Nothing on a request path answers that question for
 * an idle deployment, so the persistence provider answers it while it
 * initializes, and the collector schedule awaits that provider before it builds
 * a collector at all (`asset-collector-schedule.ts`, pinned by "brings the
 * persistence provider up before it collects anything").
 *
 * This file is the database half of that: the provider call below stands in for
 * the one the schedule makes, and what is asserted is that the declaration
 * really does land early enough. Legacy rows first, provider second, and the
 * very first collector pass backfills and marks rather than refusing.
