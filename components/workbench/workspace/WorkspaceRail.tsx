/**
 * The workspace's navigation — the one tree for the whole Pro surface.
 *
 * There used to be two: this tree on `/workspace`, and a two-row rail beside
 * an attached session. They are the same navigation and are now the same
 * component: whatever is open (a course, a conversation, both) is marked
 * `aria-current` in this tree, and opening something is a click on a row here
 * rather than a route change to a different shell.
 *
 * Shape, deliberately:
 *  - TWO TABS over one body — chat and courses, a segmented control of two
 *    equal halves. The three used to be stacked peer sections, which meant
 *    three heads, three counts and three resting windows competing for one
 *    column; only one of the three is ever the thing you came for. Tabs make
 *    the active list own the rail's height (`workspace-paging` re-tuned with
 *    it);
 *  - the courses tab is ONE TREE, and only FOLDERS are containers in it. A
 *    course that is in no folder is a row at the tree's top level, under the
 *    folders — not a member of an "unfiled" group, which was a head, a count
 *    and a twisty around the absence of filing, and which let one press fold
 *    away the bulk of the list. There is still exactly one unbounded list in
 *    the rail, and therefore one pager;
 *  - course and chat rows are both compact, single-line entries. A course keeps
 *    the stronger name treatment and states its page count at the far edge,
 *    matching the folder/count rhythm above it; run state belongs to the chat
 *    row that is actually running;
 *  - the course list is `useHomeDiscovery`'s `classrooms`, never a second
 *    `GET /api/stages` — a rail that contradicts the grid beside it is worse
 *    than a rail that is one render late;
 *  - long lists reveal one page at a time (`workspace-paging`), because this
 *    account has 139 courses and "reveal everything" is not a navigation;
 *  - the header utilities the classic chrome carries — language, theme,
 *    feedback, community, account — survive at the foot, as the SAME
 *    components SiteHeader mounts, with the two least-pressed behind one ⋯;
 *  - rows are draggable: courses and sessions reorder against a hairline
 *    insertion line, a course dropped on a folder row is filed into it, a
 *    course dropped on the BLANK GROUND at the tree's foot is moved back out to
 *    the top level (Finder's own gesture — the tree lost its "unfiled" row,
 *    and with it the only place a filed course could be dropped to unfile it),
 *    and the resulting sequence is decided entirely by `workspace-order` — this
 *    file only wires the events;
 *  - every row you authored carries the same hover-revealed ⋯: rename edits
 *    the name IN PLACE (the row becomes an input; Enter commits, Escape leaves
 *    it alone) and delete asks first. Folders and courses answer to different
 *    endpoints — `PATCH /api/folders/:id` and `PATCH /api/stages/:id` — but not
 *    to different interactions.
 *
 * Collapsed, it becomes a 60px icon strip: an explicit expand button in the
 * header slot, a new-session button, one glyph per destination (which expands
 * the rail INTO that destination — the chat tab, the course tab), and the
 * utilities. The compact header is an action rather than a second brand/home
 * affordance, so the way back out is visible immediately.
 *
 * It folds from its own header — the row with the wordmark and the PRO pill —
 * with the same `PaneFoldButton` the conversation and the classroom use. It used
 * to fold from a pill floating in the middle of its seam, on the argument that
 * the rail had no header; that left one line carrying two meanings, because the
 * seam is also the rail's width drag. The seam now resizes and nothing else,
 * like the other two.

                    inside their folder; everything else sits in the tree. The
                    page window is still one per list (`unfiled`), because this

            It is a SIBLING of the rows, never their ancestor — `useTreeDrag`
            hit-tests with `closest()`, so a zone wrapping the tree would turn
            every row into an unfile target and break reordering outright. And

 * as views. Two lists that take turns owning the whole body ARE a mode, and at
 * rail width the underline was the quietest mark in a column of louder ones:
 * the selected tab got a 2px hairline while every row beneath it could take a
 * filled pill. So the switch spends the width it has — one track, two halves,
 * the selected half on a raised solid ground — and becomes the first thing the
 * eye lands on under the compose button.
 *
 * The truncation the old shape was avoiding is real and is paid for in TYPE,
 * not in width: "COURSES" as a 10px uppercase label with 0.145em of tracking
 * does not fit in half of a 200px rail, so the label drops the case transform
 * and the tracking (see `.ws-navtab-label`). Same two words, a third narrower,
 * and still legible at the narrowest rail.
 *
 * NOTHING but the label. Each half used to carry its list's total; a switch is
 * for choosing which list you are looking at, and how many things are in the
 * other one is not part of that choice — the totals said nothing you could act
 * on and were the loudest numerals in the rail. No glyph either, for the same
 * reason: a two-word text label does not need one. Run state is likewise not
 * summarized here; it stays on the chat row inside the chat list.

 * The classic header's utilities, at the rail's foot.

 * These are SiteHeader's own components — locale, theme, feedback, community
 * and the account entry each keep exactly one implementation. Nothing the
 * classic chrome offers is dropped; what changes is only which of them are on
 * the surface. Theme and account are one press away because they are pressed
 * daily; feedback and the community links are a press further, behind one
 * quiet ⋯, because a rail is navigation first and a settings bar second.
 *
 * The settings entry lives here too, in the slot the removed saved-courses
 * drawer left in this cluster (a product decision on this branch: the drawer
 * could only ever render empty, and the model/provider dialog is the one
 * surface-wide setting the workspace still needs). It is the same dialog the
 * classic home opens from its header pill; the rail trigger owns its own
 * mount.
 *
 * The product ships no reusable notification bell (the only Bell in the tree
 * belongs to the community dialog), so there is nothing to cluster here for
 * notifications.
