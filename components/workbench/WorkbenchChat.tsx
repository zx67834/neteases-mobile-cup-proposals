/**
 * WorkbenchChat — the Pro workbench conversation, and (until the first page
 * lands) the whole surface.
 *
 * The visual system is the OpenPBL kimi-chat vocabulary adapted to a
 * single-agent surface; see `chat/workbench-chat.css` for the token mapping
 * and `chat/chat-timeline.tsx` for the layout rules.
 *
 * The composer never closes: the session is a conversation, and a run ending
 * (succeeded/failed/cancelled) just means the agent is listening again.
 * Every submit goes to `POST /messages`, steered into a live run, or
 * driving a new run on an idle session. An `ask_user` question card's answer is
 * the same submit with the option's label as its text — the answer protocol is
 * "the next user message" and nothing more. While a question is UNANSWERED the
 * composer is TAKEN OVER by its form (`chat/question-form.tsx`): the run ended on
 * `ask_user`, so there is nothing to type into until it is answered, and its
 * transcript row is at the bottom of a long log and easy to scroll past. The
 * dismiss control hands the box back — the question stays open, the form just stops holding it
 * (`dismissedQuestionKey` below), and the transcript card offers the way back.
 * While a run is live the composer
 * shows STOP (POST cancel) instead of send; that ends the run, never the
 * session. Enter still barges in.
 * Send/cancel failures surface as a sonner toast, not inline chrome.
