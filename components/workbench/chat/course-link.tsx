/**
 * The in-chat course link — how a course gets onto the screen.
 *
 * The agent talks about a course; this is the thing you click to look at it.
 * It is the primary way the right pane is filled, so it is deliberately LIGHT:
 * no thumbnail, no media card, no preview. A glyph, a name, and how many pages.
 *
 * ALWAYS PRESSABLE, AND ALWAYS THE SAME PRESS. The card used to end in a state
 * cue — open-in-side-pane / switch-to-tab / now-showing — driven by the pane's open set and its
 * active id. That cue is gone with the state machine behind it: it reported a
 * fact the reader gets by glancing right, it made a card look conditional when
 * it never was, and it was the loudest thing on a row whose subject is a course
 * name. One press, one meaning: put this course on screen, expanding the right
 * pane when it is shut (`openCourse` in the shell does both). Nothing here is
 * ever disabled, and nothing about the middle column moves.
 *
 * Two forms, one component:
 *
 *   block  — the answer produced or was pointed at this classroom. Its own line,
 *            with the page count at the far edge. One exchange's set of these
 *            sits at the tail of that answer (see `SessionCourseLink` below).
 *   inline — the course is named mid-sentence, by the agent's own prose
 *            (`text-block.tsx` upgrades a `/classroom/<id>` anchor). A pill, so a
 *            paragraph that mentions three courses does not become a wall of
 *            cards. It is INDEPENDENT of the per-exchange rule: prose is prose,
 *            and a sentence naming a classroom is not a receipt for one. Its
 *            press does exactly what the block form's does.
 *
 * Every visual decision lives in ONE place, `wbStyles.courseLink` — degrading
 * the block form to a plain underlined link is a change to that table and
 * nowhere else.
 *
 * NO ORIGIN, NO PAIRING, NO ASSOCIATION. The link says what the course is and
 * where it will appear. It never says which chat made it, and clicking it does
 * not attach, bind or pair anything: it joins the id to this chat's ordered tab
 * set, which is view state and nothing more.

/**
 * ONE EXCHANGE'S classroom cards, at the tail of the answer that produced them.
 *
 * The artifact-card pattern: the answer says what it did in prose, and the things
 * it produced or was pointed at are named underneath it, clickable. Which
 * classrooms those are is decided in the fold (`lib/workbench/run-courses` for
 * what counts, `session-store`'s `agent_end` for when it lands — an exchange, not
 * a pi `turn`) — this renders that list and nothing else, so the timeline holds no
 * course state of its own and a replay paints the identical tail.
 *
 * Over three, the rest fold behind a `+N` (`splitRunCourseCards`). The expansion
 * is local, ephemeral UI state on purpose: it is a disclosure, not a preference,
 * and nothing about which cards an answer has may depend on what a previous
 * reader clicked.
 *
 * NO stageIds AT ALL is the legacy unbound row — a v1 transcript's page
 * checkpoint carried no stage id, so the row falls back to the session's own
 * stage, which lives beside the fold rather than in it. Not yet known (a
 * `?session=` deep link attaches before the meta fetch lands) means nothing is
 * rendered rather than a link that cannot work.
