/**
 * Stage — top-level classroom container. Standalone classrooms dispatch
 * between the two chrome roots based on `useStageStore.mode`:
 *
 *   mode === 'edit'                → EditChromeRoot
 *   mode === 'playback' / 'autonomous' → PlaybackChromeRoot
 *
 * When this classroom is HOSTED — mounted inside the Pro workspace's classroom
 * pane rather than filling a route — the dispatch below is not replaced, it is
 * merely stripped of the chrome that the host already provides: no header, no
 * global controls or Pro switch (the pane IS Pro-locked). Hosted chrome is
 * EDIT-LOCKED: the pane declares the lock once (`WorkbenchPanelState.editPinned`)
 * and this component reads it back, so no entry path — a course the agent just
 * created, a restored tab, a tab switch, a reload — gets to decide otherwise.
 * The learning chrome is reachable only through Start Learning, which clears
 * the lock at the pane. Everything else resolves synchronously between the
 * neutral loading shell and edit, so a hosted first paint can never be
 * playback. Deliberately not a third
 * `StageMode` — `StageMode` lives in the
 * published `@openmaic/dsl` and is persisted with the stage, whereas "this is
 * rendered inside the workspace right now" is view state that must not outlive
 * the tab.
 *
 * The host itself owns the three-pane layout, the conversation, the session
 * stream and the course sync. Stage's only responsibilities are: mode
 * dispatch and Pro Switch toggle wiring (calls into
 * PlaybackChromeRoot.teardown via ref before flipping mode).
