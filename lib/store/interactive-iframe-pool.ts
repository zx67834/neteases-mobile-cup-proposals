/**
 * Keep-alive pool for interactive scene iframes (#619).
 *
 * Interactive scenes render their content in an `<iframe>`. When that element
 * unmounts or is re-parented (Pro mode toggle, scene switch and back, any
 * PlaybackChromeRoot remount) the browser drops the document and re-parses /
 * re-runs from scratch, losing in-iframe state. To avoid that, the actual
 * iframe elements live in a single stable host (`InteractiveIframeHost`)
 * mounted at the `Stage` root, outside the reconciled scene subtree. This store
 * is the coordination layer between the in-tree placeholder (`InteractiveRenderer`)
 * and that host: it tracks, per scene, the content to render, the live on-screen
 * rect to position the iframe over, and whether it should currently be visible.
 *
 * Entries are keyed by sceneId and persist across scene/mode changes — a scene's
 * iframe is only rebuilt when its content actually changes. A small LRU cap
 * bounds how many documents stay resident in memory.
