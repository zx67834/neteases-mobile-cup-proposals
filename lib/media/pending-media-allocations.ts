/**
 * Media that is stored but has nowhere to be referenced from yet.
 *
 * During the first generation pass, media runs alongside content: an image is
 * usually finished before the slide that asked for it has been built, so the
 * write-back finds no slot for its placeholder anywhere. The bytes are already
 * paid for and stored, so the allocation is held here rather than dropped —
 * keyed by the placeholder the future slide will carry.
 *
 * Two consumers close the loop. The orchestrator refuses to call the provider
 * again for a placeholder that already has an allocation waiting, which is what
 * keeps a second pass in the same run from paying twice. And the scene commit
 * path drains the entries a newly built scene matches, rewriting its slots
 * before that scene is ever saved — so the document never records the
 * placeholder in the first place.
 *
 * Entries are per stage and live only for the session that made them. One left
 * behind means the scene it was waiting for never arrived (a failed or
 * abandoned generation), so no document will ever name its id. Under
 * server-backed persistence the server expires exactly that: an allocation is
 * pending until the first document write commits it, and one no document
 * commits within `ASSET_PENDING_TTL_MS` is released by the collector's entry
 * pass, taking its bytes with it after the grace period. Losing this map on a
 * tab close therefore loses the record, not the storage.
 *
 * Alongside the parked entries this module keeps a second, non-draining record:
 * every placeholder this session has ever allocated for, and what it allocated.
 * The parked map answers "does this reference have bytes waiting for a slide";
 * the record answers "is this placeholder stale", which is what the persistence
 * write boundary needs. A snapshot captured before a rewrite — a queued
 * autosave, an editor-history entry, a departing-course save — still carries the
 * placeholder, and without the record the write boundary has no way to know the
 * document has moved past it.
