/**
 * Media Generation Orchestrator
 *
 * Dispatches media generation API calls for all mediaGenerations across outlines.
 * Runs entirely on the frontend — calls /api/generate/image and /api/generate/video,
 * fetches result blobs and updates the Zustand store.
 *
 * Where the bytes land, and what the document ends up pointing at, depends on
 * how durable the document is:
 *
 * - Browser-only: bytes go to the local `mediaFiles` table and the document
 *   keeps its `gen_img_*` / `gen_vid_*` placeholder. Document and media share
 *   one lifetime, so the placeholder is a complete address.
 * - Server-backed: the document outlives this browser, so the bytes go to the
 *   asset pool first and the id the pool allocated is written back into the
 *   document. Only then is the task done. The local table becomes a cache for
 *   this tab, never the source of truth, and "already generated?" is answered
 *   by the document instead of by that cache.

/**
 * The pass currently running for a stage, if one is.
 *
 * Media passes for one course are serial, and that is the whole concurrency
 * model: there is no per-element bookkeeping, because there is nothing for it
 * to arbitrate. A replacement pass aborts its predecessor and then waits for it
 * to settle, so by the time it looks at the document nothing is in flight —
 * a commit that had already started has finished (its bytes are stored and its
 * reference written, so the new pass sees a resolved slide and skips it), and
 * an element the aborted pass never reached is still a placeholder and gets
 * collected like any other.
 *
 * Three rounds of per-element claims taught the lesson this replaces: every
 * refinement of "who owns this element right now" created a new way to strand
 * one. Waiting has no such states.
 *
 * The wait is unbounded, and deliberately so. A commit is uncancellable — the
 * asset client takes no signal and a document write cannot be half-undone — so
 * a stalled upload holds this course's media queue until it settles or the page
 * is reloaded. Abandoning the wait on a deadline was tried and reverted: it
 * turns an element whose commit is still alive into a retryable one, and a
 * Retry then runs a second commit for the same placeholder against the first —
 * two provider calls, two allocations, and a placeholder-keyed record that the
 * loser can erase from under the winner. That is precisely the overlap this
 * design exists to remove, so the queue waits.
