/**
 * Pool-first byte resolution for export paths, with the fallback chain every
 * export surface shares.
 *
 * A same-id replacement commits the new bytes to the pool first; if the
 * compatibility write then fails, the task records
 * `MEDIA_COMPATIBILITY_STORE_LAGGED` and the document deliberately keeps the
 * same reference. Rendering resolves the pool, so every export must too --
 * otherwise it ships media the classroom no longer shows. The chain, in order:
 *
 * 1. The asset pool. An opaque ref's current bytes win whenever the pool
 *    resolves them.
 * 2. The Dexie compatibility row, optionally with its CDN URL (`ossKey`) as a
 *    byte source when the local blob is empty -- a live-mode classroom whose
 *    local blobs were LRU-evicted under storage pressure still exports a
 *    self-contained archive.
 * 3. The URL the media-resolution state machine resolves from the task, for
 *    generated media whose bytes never reached either store.
 *
 * The three historical callers (classroom ZIP, PPTX, video) differ in which
 * levels they run, how strictly they validate fetched bytes, and whether they
 * gate acceptance on the media-resolution state machine. Those differences
 * are load-bearing, so they are explicit options below rather than collapsed
 * into one policy. Returns `null` when no level yields bytes; never throws.
