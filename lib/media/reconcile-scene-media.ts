/**
 * Give a freshly built scene the allocated ids its media already has.
 *
 * Media generation runs alongside content generation, so an image is routinely
 * stored before the slide that asked for it exists. The write-back had nothing
 * to rewrite at that moment and parked the allocation; this is where it is
 * applied — on the scene object, before the scene is added to the store and
 * therefore before its first save. The document consequently never records the
 * placeholder, which is what makes one complete generation pass converge
 * instead of leaving work for the next owner load.
 *
 * The scene is mutated in place. Callers own the object at this point (it has
 * just been built by the generator and has not been handed to the store yet),
 * and rebuilding it would lose the identity the store's own migration relies
 * on.

/**

 * Every route into durable storage — a queued autosave whose snapshot was taken
 * before a rewrite landed, an editor-history entry replayed by an undo or a
 * later `applyOp`, the departing save a course switch flushes — carries content
 * captured at some earlier moment. Any of them can still hold a placeholder
 * this session has already allocated for, and writing it would undo a
 * successful write-back with no corrective flush left to follow. Point fixes at
 * each producer would leave the next producer to rediscover the same bug, so
 * the check lives here, where every producer must pass.
 *
 * The lookup is the session's allocation record, not the parked queue: a
 * placeholder whose rewrite landed long ago is exactly the case this catches.
 * Nothing is mutated in place; only the scenes and the stage that actually
 * change are rebuilt, so an unchanged snapshot writes through untouched.
 *
 * Two families of reference pass through here, because both can be stale in the
 * same snapshot for the same reason: a slide's media slots, and a speech
 * action's `audioId` after narration adoption converted it. The narration half
 * matters more than it looks: adoption never deletes the derived row, so a
 * reverted reference is adopted again on the next load and allocates a *fresh*
 * asset every time -- one leaked pool entry per clip per load, in a store that
 * only grows.
