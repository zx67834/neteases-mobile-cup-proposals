/**
 * Write an allocated asset id back into the document that asked for the media.
 *
 * Under server-backed persistence the document outlives the browser, so a
 * generation placeholder left in place is a permanent instruction to every
 * later reader to generate the same media again. This is the single write-back
 * funnel: it goes through the same document store the rest of the app writes
 * through, inside `mutateDocument`, which re-reads the current document under
 * the per-stage document lock.
 *
 * What that lock buys, exactly: the Web Locks API serializes this rewrite
 * against other writers **in this browser**, so a save running in another tab
 * of the same profile cannot interleave with the read-modify-write. It says
 * nothing about other browsers or devices, which is precisely the world a
 * shared document lives in. Against a concurrent editor elsewhere the write is
 * last-write-wins over the whole scene, because `putScene` sends the scene
 * object and the store has no conditional write to send it under. Reload-then-
 * write narrows the window to the round trip; closing it needs a compare-and-
 * swap the document contract does not have yet.
 *
 * The live stage store is updated with the same rewrite and the rewritten units
 * are marked dirty. Marking matters: an autosave round captures its snapshot
 * synchronously and writes that snapshot, so a round already in flight when the
 * rewrite lands will write the placeholder back over the allocated id. Marking
 * the same units dirty again after the rewrite leaves a corrective flush queued
 * behind it, and re-saving a scene that already holds the id is idempotent — a
 * lost write-back is not.
 *
 * An allocation this funnel cannot place is parked, never dropped, and never
 * silently reclaimed: the id may already be referenced by a write whose
 * response was lost, and the bytes are paid for either way. The one case that
 * reclaims is the one where nothing could possibly hold the id — no store write
 * was ever issued and no live scene took it.
