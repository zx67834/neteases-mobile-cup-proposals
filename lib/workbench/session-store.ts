/**
 * Workbench session store — the browser's fold over a PR1 agent-runtime job's
 * durable event log (`/api/agent/sessions/:id/events`).
 *
 * Ported from the spike's `lib/workbench/session-store.ts` and adapted to the
 * PR1 control plane: the event shapes are the runner's (`PersistedEvent` in
 * `lib/server/agent-runtime/session-store.ts`), the endpoints are the app's own
 * routes, and the spike-only event types are gone because PR1 does not emit
 * them.
 *
 * Two properties are inherited unchanged, and neither is decoration:
 *
 *  - **The rendered UI is a pure function of the applied event prefix.** The
 *    fold (`foldEvent`) is a pure function exported for tests; no event handler
 *    queries the session status endpoint. That is what makes `Last-Event-ID`
 *    resumption correct rather than approximately correct: reattaching at N and
 *    applying N+1… produces the same state as applying 1… from scratch.
 *  - **It lives outside React.** Unmounting the chat tree tears down the
 *    EventSource; the folded state survives here, and reattaching resumes from
 *    `lastEventId` instead of replaying the whole run.
