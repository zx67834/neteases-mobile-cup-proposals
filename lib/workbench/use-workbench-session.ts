/**
 * The canvas's narrow freshness sync (Mono #1960 Part 2).
 *
 * Replaces the old whole-document course sync: instead of "revision changed →
 * re-read the entire document", the canvas now keeps the manifest it rendered
 * with (`{stageRev, per-scene rev}`) and, on a trigger, re-pulls the manifest,
 * diffs it, and re-fetches ONLY the scenes whose rev changed (via
 * `GET /api/stages/:id/scenes?ids=`). One page commit moves one ~14.5kB scene
 * instead of the whole ~100kB document.
 *
 * TRIGGERS — every freshness path the spec requires:
 *   - a `stage_freshness` frame from the dedicated SSE stream
 *     (`GET /api/stages/:id/freshness`, itself woken by the 0071 DB triggers);
 *   - tab focus (`visibilitychange`);
 *   - an EventSource re-open after a drop (frames lost during the gap);
 *   - a low-frequency fallback timer (period + jitter) — the correctness
 *     backstop when the stream is dead or a signal was dropped; and
 *   - a user-triggered manual reload of a protected scene (LWW #6).
 *
 * The stream is a PURE optimization: if it never connects, the fallback still
 * converges, just on the fallback clock. This is the "push for latency, pull for correctness"
 * principle the session list already follows.
 *
 * BASELINE (why the first pass is special): the sync diffs against "the
 * manifest it rendered with", and revs live only server-side. The manifest is
 * therefore fetched BEFORE any full read, so the recorded baseline is never
 * NEWER than the content it describes (a newer-than-content baseline would
 * hide writes that landed in between — the reverse order is harmless: such a
 * scene shows up as changed on the next diff and is re-fetched once).
 *
 * Two first-pass shapes:
 *   - `bootstrapDocument` lets a host explicitly delegate its initial document
 *     read to this sync. This is a generic cold-start capability and is not
 *     driven by chat/session status.
 *   - otherwise the classroom load owns the store: the sync never does a full
 *     read. If the store is already warm it records a ZEROED baseline so the
 *     next pass verifies the true scene revs exactly once; if still cold it
 *     records the real manifest (safe — the classroom load's content lands
 *     after, so any write between the two is caught by the next diff).
 *
 * FAILURE CONTRACT (the old `if (!doc) continue;` fix): an unreadable
 * manifest or document is now EXPLICIT — it throws into a bounded retry
 * budget, is logged, and the fallback clock keeps ticking underneath. It is
 * never silently swallowed, so a course that does not exist yet cannot park
 * the canvas on an empty state forever.
 *
 * STABLE REFERENCE (feature 3 of 3): incremental applies never rebuild the
 * `scenes` array wholesale — `mergeFetchedScenes` returns the SAME array when
 * nothing changed, so a deck the agent did not touch does not re-render every
 * consumer that memoizes on `scenes`.
 *
 * EDIT-STATE PROTECTION (REMOVED, #1961 decision change 2026-08-23): the read path no
 * longer freezes the page being edited — an agent refresh replaces it
 * outright. The user's typed data is guarded on the WRITE side instead: a
 * save veto retains the pending dirt and retries once the baseline converges
 * (see `lib/store/stage.ts`), so a false veto can no longer silently eat
 * keystrokes.
 *
 * FAILURE CONTRACT (cr D3-F1 hardening): a pass whose batch fetch returns
 * NOTHING for a non-empty request aborts WITHOUT advancing the rendered
 * manifest or the write baseline — "could not fetch" must never be recorded
 * as "already up to date" (that is how a zeroed baseline polluted the write
 * baseline and permanently vetoed every save on >200-scene courses).
