// Unified Action System.
//
// The Action contract — the playback verb set agents use to drive a
// presentation — now lives in `@openmaic/dsl` and is re-exported below, so the
// runtime engine, renderer, importer, and this app all share one source of
// truth. Both the online (streaming) and offline (playback) paths consume the
// same Action types.
//
// This module is a thin re-export shim (same pattern as `@/lib/types/stage`):
// existing `import { … } from '@/lib/types/action'` callers keep working
// unchanged.
