 *
 * This authenticator is only consulted for `/runtime/*`. Document and asset
 * requests skip it and take their principal from the 30-day anonymous owner
 * cookie. Document reads are capability-by-id (stage id, no owner check);
 * writes and deletes compare that cookie-derived owner. `x-learner-key` is a
 * client-supplied runtime partition key, not a document-access token.
 *
 * Suitable only for localhost or trusted-network, single-user deployments.
 * Production must replace this module with real session verification and
 * derive learner identity from server-controlled claims.
