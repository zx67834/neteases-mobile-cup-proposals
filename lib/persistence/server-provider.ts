/**
 * Shared server bootstrap used by both HTTP persistence and Pi composition.
 *
 * The memo is keyed on the TRIMMED connection string, and the pool is built
 * from it, because callers disagree about whose job that is: the persistence
 * route and the agent runtime pass `process.env.DATABASE_URL` as it is, while
 * the collector schedule and the shutdown hook trim it first — they need the
 * trimmed value anyway, to tell a blank variable from an unset one. A
 * whitespace-padded `DATABASE_URL` would otherwise memoise twice and open two
 * pools for one database in one process, and every one of those callers would
 * be individually correct. Normalizing at the one seam they all go through
 * costs nothing and leaves no spelling that can split them.
