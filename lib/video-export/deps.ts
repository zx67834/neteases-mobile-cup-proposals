/**
 * Dependency-injection boundary for the video-timeline compiler.
 *
 * The compiler is pure (issue #864 / #854 AC: the IR must be produced and
 * inspected without FFmpeg / Chrome / DOM). Everything it needs from live app
 * state — audio/video durations, which assets actually exist — enters through
 * these **synchronous** interfaces. The app provides Dexie/DOM-backed
 * implementations that pre-resolve the data (durations are stored at TTS time,
 * #861); tests provide plain in-memory stubs. Neither reaches into the compiler.
 *
 * Sync by design: with durations pre-resolved (#861) the whole compile is a pure
 * synchronous fold, which is what makes it trivially unit-testable — a stub is a
 * literal object, not a Promise-returning mock.
 *
 * Pure: types only, from `@openmaic/dsl`.
