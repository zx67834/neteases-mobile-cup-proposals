 * Configure the app-wide runtime persistence backend and learner identity.
 *
 * This is a client-bootstrap-only, single-shot API. It is not SSR-safe and is
 * not intended for request-scoped stores or identity. Call it at module-level
 * bootstrap, before rendering any runtime consumer; a component effect is too
 * late. A second call always throws, even if runtime storage has not been used
 * yet. Once resolution has started, configuration stays sealed so a live app
 * cannot split data across backends or learner partitions. Omitted fields
 * retain the browser IndexedDB backend and anonymous device-key behavior.
 *
 * A store factory is called lazily by `getRuntimeStore()` until it first
 * succeeds. The configured learner-key provider is invoked only on first
 * resolution; concurrent callers share that resolution and its first resolved
 * value is retained for the client session. Identity changes mid-session are
 * the application layer's responsibility (reload or a `mergeLearner` flow).
 *
 * Dev-mode limitation: configuration and consumer caches live in separate
 * modules, so partial HMR replacement can fragment their module-level state.
 * Reload the page after changing bootstrap configuration.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * configureRuntimeStorage({
 *   store: new HttpRuntimeStore({ baseUrl: '/api' }),
 *   learnerKey: () => clientSessionStore.getState().userId,
 * });
 * ```
