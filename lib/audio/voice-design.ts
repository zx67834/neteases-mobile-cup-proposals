/**
 * Provider-neutral per-agent voice design.
 *
 * A `VoiceDesign` describes an agent's vocal identity (not personality) as a
 * 3-layer recipe. It is consumed by any TTS provider: as an inline voice
 * prompt where supported, or as the seed for a registered/cloned voice
 * (see `voice-registration.ts`). Nothing here is VoxCPM-specific.
 *
 * The type itself lives in `@openmaic/dsl` (it is part of the persisted
 * `GeneratedAgentConfig` contract, so the roster's voice travels with the
 * stage document); this module re-exports it and owns the runtime helpers.
