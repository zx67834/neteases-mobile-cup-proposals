/**
 * Convert a course's pre-allocation narration to stored assets, for free.
 *
 * A course narrated before this application stored media server-side holds a
 * derived key on every speech action -- `tts_s<order>_<action>` -- and the
 * bytes for it only in this browser's local audio table. The document outlives
 * the browser now, so those references are a promise the course cannot keep:
 * the author's next device, and every visitor, reads an id nothing can resolve.
 *
 * The bytes are already paid for, so the author's own browser converts them
 * rather than re-synthesizing: allocate the clip in the pool, write the
 * allocated id back into the speech action, and mirror the row locally under
 * its new id. No provider is called, and a course converges on the first load
 * by an owner who still has the cache.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 * - It does not adopt a row that belongs to another course. The derived key
 *   contains no stage id and `audioFiles` is keyed by id alone, so two courses
 *   can mint the same key -- a PPTX import numbers its scenes and actions
 *   deterministically, which makes the first slide of every imported deck
 *   `tts_s1_speech-scene-p1`. Locally that only means one course plays
 *   another's clip in one browser; adopting it would write that clip into the
 *   shared document permanently, for every device and every visitor. So the
 *   row's own `stageId` must not name a different course, and a legacy row
 *   from before that column existed is admitted only when its recorded text
 *   matches the action being converted.
 * - It does not run for a visitor. Ownership is the same gate every other
 *   spending or writing path uses, and it fails closed.
 * - It does not run in browser-only mode, where a derived key is a complete
 *   address and the document and the audio share one lifetime.
 * - It does not synthesize anything. A speech action whose bytes are not here,
 *   or whose only candidate row cannot be shown to belong to it, is left
 *   exactly as it is, still carrying its derived id. That narration is lost,
 *   and paying a provider to replace it is a decision for the author, not a
 *   side effect of opening a course.

/**
 * The adoption running for a course, if one is.
 *
 * A run is a loop of uncancellable uploads: aborting it stops the loop between
 * clips, but the upload already in flight still finishes and still writes back,
 * because abandoning it would orphan the asset it just paid for. A second run
 * started while that tail is settling — a surface that re-enters the course, or
 * two surfaces mounted at once — could hand the same clip a second allocation
 * and leave one of them referenced by nothing. So a course adopts one run at a
 * time.
 *
 * A later caller QUEUES behind the tail rather than being handed it. Handing it
 * over was tried and is the same bug from the other side: the run a re-entry
 * inherits is bound to the signal that was just aborted, so it stops at its
 * next clip and the caller — which has a live signal and a course open — is
 * told the work is done. Waiting and then scanning again costs a lookup on a
 * course that has nothing left, and finishes the clips the abort cut off on one
 * that does.
 *
 * At most ONE rescan is queued at a time, and it belongs to every caller waiting
 * for it. A chain would be pointless — the first rescan converts whatever is
 * left, and every later one would find an allocated id on every action — so
 * what coalescing buys is precisely a bounded queue: N callers no longer build
 * N sequential runs, and the rescan starts with a signal that is aborted only
 * once every caller sharing it has left, so a surface that closes cannot stop
 * work another surface is still waiting for.
 *
 * What it does NOT buy, and this is worth stating because it looks like it
 * should: it is no protection against a stalled upload. The queued rescan is
 * chained off the run in flight, so a `putAsset` that never settles leaves the
 * rescan unstarted and every waiting caller pending, exactly as a chain would.
 * That is the same uncancellable tail the media pass has, recorded as a known
 * limitation rather than solved here.

  // deck-wide memory of one either. It attempts, every load, every clip it
  // holds that an earlier refusal in the same run has not already answered for,
  // and lets the ones that do not fit wait for a bigger ceiling.
  //
  // Sharing the media pass's marker was tried across several rounds and the
  // coupling is what kept failing: the flag means "do not spend money here",
  // which is a claim adoption is in no position to make. One clip larger than
  // current headroom was enough to stand a course's whole image pass down
  // indefinitely -- on a store that had just accepted adoption's other clips.
  // The marker is now written only by the paths whose refusal cost a provider
  // call.
  //
  // What keeps a load bounded is not memory of an earlier load but the store's
  // own arithmetic, applied within this one. The rule is
  // `used + addedBytes > quotaBytes`, and `used` only grows while a run is
  // uploading, so a clip of size s refused for want of room implies every clip
  // of size >= s is refused for the rest of this run. That is an implication,
  // not a guess about the deployment: it needs no flag, no key and nothing
  // carried across loads.
  //
  // So the run remembers the smallest size it has been refused, and skips
  // anything at least that large without uploading it. A smaller clip is still
  // attempted, because it may fit.
  //
  // The exact cost, since an approximation here is what the previous version of
  // this comment got wrong: on a deck the store refuses entirely, one upload
  // per successive size minimum IN DOCUMENT ORDER. That is one for a deck whose
  // clips grow, about ln N for an arbitrary one, and N for a deck whose clips
  // only shrink -- a long opener followed by terser lines is exactly that
  // shape. The bound resets per run and a refused clip stays outstanding, so
  // every fully-refused load costs the same; no load is cheaper than the first.
  // On a deck the store has room for it costs nothing, because nothing is
  // refused.
  //
  // Making that one upload for ANY ordering needs a fact only the store has:
  // its remaining headroom. The 507 already carries a `details` channel that
  // the client surfaces and the server leaves empty, so putting the headroom
  // there would let this skip everything above it after a single refusal. That
  // is a cross-package change and a follow-up, not something to fake here.
  //
  // The implication itself is exact, not merely conservative. Quota is charged
  // at the blob's full length with no discount for a duplicate, the sum it is
  // checked against joins entries to blobs -- so the byte collector, which only
  // removes blobs no entry names, cannot lower it -- and the check takes a
  // per-principal lock before summing, so it never reads an uncommitted or
  // rolled-back row. Replace and delete are refused to every browser. Nothing a
