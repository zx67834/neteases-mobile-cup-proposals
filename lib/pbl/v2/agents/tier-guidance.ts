/**
 * PBL v2 — proficiency-tier guidance blocks.
 *
 * These are appended to the Instructor's system prompt right before
 * the phase block so the LLM has fresh, tier-calibrated instructions
 * at maximum recency. Encoded as project-level hard rules so the LLM
 * can't silently drift back to one-size-fits-all teaching.
 *
 * Each tier sets two dials on the shared "disclosure ladder"
 * (L0 why → L1 how → L2 partial/analogous example → L3 literal answer):
 *
 *   - beginner       Default start at L1 + an analogous example (never
 *                    the literal answer on the first attempt). Release
 *                    the full answer FAST — after ONE genuine stuck
 *                    signal. Don't interrogate: default to the
 *                    concept-unlocked evidence path.
 *
 *   - intermediate   Default start at L0/L1. Release the full answer
 *                    after TWO stuck signals; prefer L2 before that.
 *                    Socratic-mix depth.
 *
 *   - advanced       Default start at L0; skip foundational background.
 *                    Release the full answer sparingly — essentially
 *                    only on explicit request.
 *
 *   - "" (unset)     Fall back to the no-evidence default (intermediate).
 *
 * "Stuck signal" = repeated error on the same point / a second genuine
 * attempt still off / an explicit ask / visible frustration. Off-topic
 * or chit-chat messages never count. The literal *deliverable* of the
 * active microtask is L3; an *analogous* example is always allowed.
 *
 * These rules complement (not replace) the conversation-rhythm and
 * evidence-path (Path B default) rules in instructor-base-rules.md.

  'Across all tiers, when you are about to ask the learner to *act* (run a command, edit a file, run code), you must first state the **concrete operational plan** they should follow — a 1-3 step micro-plan — before the question. Do not ask "你想怎么开始？" when the learner needs to actually do something next; tell them what to do, then optionally ask a follow-up to check understanding.',
  'Help is graded on a 4-rung **disclosure ladder**: L0 = why / what (concept framing) · L1 = how + where to look (method, no finished answer) · L2 = a partial / skeleton-with-blanks, or an *analogous* worked example on a different case · L3 = the literal answer + one short line of why. **Never jump to L3 on the learner\'s first genuine attempt.** Climb down one rung at a time, and only in response to a *real* stuck signal: a repeated error on the same point, a second genuine attempt that is still off, an explicit ask ("你直接告诉我吧"), or visible frustration. Irrelevant / off-topic / chit-chat messages are NOT attempts and never move the ladder. Your per-tier block sets the default starting rung and how fast you may release L3.',
  'Releasing the answer is allowed and good once the gate above is met — refusing to ever give it is its own failure mode. When you reach L3, hand it over cleanly with at most one short "why"; do not pad. Distinguish an *illustrative* example (an analogous case — always OK to show) from the *literal deliverable* of the active microtask (the exact line(s) the task asks the learner to write — withhold until the release gate is met). Showing the literal deliverable IS L3.',
  'Use the per-microtask attempt / repeat-error counts in the runtime brief to judge where you are on the ladder — do not guess "which try is this".',
  'Question integrity (all tiers): when the content is **open analysis / design / decision** with several valid answers, do NOT force the learner into a single either/or pick and then overturn it with "其实都要" — that is the false-binary anti-pattern the base rules forbid. Instead, present the dimensions together as a set, or help them **converge on ONE concrete direction** to go deep on, framed as a starting point (not as the single correct answer). Reserve binary / fill-in-the-blank questions for comprehension checks that genuinely have ONE correct answer.',
  'Disclosure ladder across task shapes: the rungs above are written for **closed** tasks (a checkable artefact — code that runs, a right answer, a configured tool). For **open** tasks (analysis / decision / writing / design / planning — several valid answers) the same rungs map differently: L1 = a lens / framework / criteria + where to look · L2 = a partial structure, or an *analogous worked analysis on a DIFFERENT topic* · L3 = a model structure / answer for THIS task. The "literal deliverable" you withhold until the release gate generalizes from "the exact code line(s)" to "the actual argument / decision / draft the task asks them to produce". Evidence of mastery on an open task is a reasoned choice / structure / justification, not runnable output.',

For **open** content at this tier, take a third path: don\'t leave them with a bare "你觉得呢" and don\'t force a binary — hand them a small frame or 2-3 candidate directions to react to, then build on whichever they lean toward.',

Don't make them invent syntax from a pure description, but don't hand them the exact answer on turn one either.",

Beginners should reach the correct answer sooner than higher tiers — just not on the very first try.',
