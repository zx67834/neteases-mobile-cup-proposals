/**
 * PBL v2 — Simulator agent (SCENARIO ONLY).
 *
 * Drives one in-character role-play turn for a scenario project's
 * `scenarioStage === 'roleplay'` milestone. It is a deliberately thin
 * sibling of `runInstructorTurn`:
 *
 *   - zero teaching rules / tools (no observation / closing-check /
 *     synthesis / advance) — the character only role-plays;
 *   - its own SSE contract identical to the Instructor route (token
 *     deltas + a final `message` project_patch + `done`), so the
 *     existing client stream loop handles it unchanged;
 *   - all messages it emits carry `roleType: 'simulator'` (the speaking
 *     character, with `characterId`) or `roleType: 'system'` (neutral
 *     scene narration), and land on the dedicated Simulator thread
 *     (`PBL_SIMULATOR_AGENT_ID`) — never the Instructor thread.
 *
 * It is ONLY reached for scenario projects in a roleplay stage; every
 * entry point is gated. Ordinary projects never invoke it.
 *
 * Scope (increment 3): in-character conversation + deterministic
 * scene-entry narration. Beat advancement / evidence gating are
 * intentionally NOT here — they land in increment 4.
