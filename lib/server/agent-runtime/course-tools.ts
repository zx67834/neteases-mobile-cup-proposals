/**
 * The stage read/patch toolset — the agent's document-level DSL surface.
 *
 * This layer combines the generic stage DSL (`read_stage`, `patch_stage`,
 * `grep_stage` from `./dsl-tools`) with page generation, playback, deck
 * structure, media promotion, and preview tools, plus the stage-level CRUD
 * they need (`create_stage`, folder organization, `rename_stage`, and
 * `read_stage_outline` from `./curriculum-tools`) for the background runner.
 *
 * What this layer owns:
 *
 *  - **Owner-scoped writes.** Every tool receives ONE store bound to the run's
 *    session owner. The owner never appears in a model-visible parameter;
 *    stages are readable by id, while foreign writes are refused.
 *  - **Sequential scheduling for document writers.** `patch_stage` loads the
 *    whole document, applies its change in memory and writes the scene back.
 *    The agent routinely emits several writers as PARALLEL tool calls in one
 *    turn, and then they all load the same snapshot and overwrite each other —
 *    the last writer wins, every sibling op is lost while still reporting
 *    success. The write set is derived from the shared
 *    `STAGE_WRITER_TOOL_NAMES` registry (the same list that arms client-side
 *    write ownership) and declared `executionMode: 'sequential'` to pi, so a
 *    batch containing a writer runs entirely sequentially and reads next to a
 *    write observe committed state.
 *  - **The DSL compatibility prompt block.** `DSL_TOOLS_PROMPT` teaches the
 *    model the current tool names (legacy transcripts named the retired
 *    per-type editors) and is layered into every runner prompt by
 *    `buildRunnerCoursePrompt` (runner-contract.ts).

 *
 * pi is the scheduler, so the requirement is declared to pi rather than

 * containing ANY call to a `sequential` tool runs entirely through
 * `executeToolCallsSequential`. That is deliberately stronger than serializing
 * only the writers against each other — it also orders the READS in the same
 * batch, so a `read_stage` next to an edit observes committed state instead of
 * the pre-write snapshot, which is the other half of what made the agent loop.
 *
 * The cost is that a batch mixing a write with otherwise-parallel reads loses
 * that parallelism. That is the intended trade: a lost write is not
 * self-correcting, a slower turn is.
