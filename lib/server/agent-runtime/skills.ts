/**
 * Skills — pi-native discovery/invocation plus the outline adapter.
 *
 * Each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` and an optional structural
 * constraint file:
 *
 *  1. **Agent discovery.** pi's `loadSkills()` parses frontmatter and
 *     `formatSkillsForSystemPrompt()` lists name/description/location. A match
 *     is invoked by pi's native `read` tool reading SKILL.md.
 *  2. **Outline prompt.** The skill body plus rendered constraints ride into
 *     the outline generator's `teacherContext` slot, so the generator itself —
 *     a separate LLM call the agent never sees inside — plans under the skill.
 *  3. **Post-generation check.** The constraint file is machine-checked
 *     against the returned outline. Violations come back in the tool result as
 *     a diagnostic; the agent decides whether to re-plan.
 *
 * Every choice — the user's and the model's — lives in the durable pi transcript
 * as a successful SKILL.md `read`, which is also how activation is restored after
 * a crash or deploy handoff. A skill the user chose gets that read SYNTHESIZED for
 * it up front (`skill-preload.ts`) rather than a delivery form of its own: one
 * shape, so the first message of a session and the fifth behave identically.
 * `skillInvocationPrompt` below is pi's inline form and is no longer on the
 * runner's path.
