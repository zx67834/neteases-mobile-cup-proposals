/**
 * One resolver for the base origin used to build classroom media serving
 * URLs (`mediaServingUrl` in `classroom-media-generation.ts`).
 *
 * Providers that hand back a hosted URL are stored directly and never touch
 * this resolver. It exists for the BYTE-FALLBACK branch only: byte-only
 * providers (raw audio/image data, no URL) are still written locally and
 * served through THIS app's own `/api/classroom-media/...` route, so those
 * serving URLs must be same-origin with the app instance the caller is
 * talking to, never with a different product's origin.
 *
 * ACCEPTED LIMITATION: URL-direct storage trades away the deletion-revocation
 * gate and the `Cache-Control: private` posture of /api/classroom-media; the
 * route REMAINS for legacy records (old courses still reference it), so its
 * tombstone veto stays in place.
 *
 * The old code fell back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIN_SITE_ORIGIN` when no origin
 * was threaded; that env is the MAIN SITE origin (a different product), where
 * the classroom-media route does not exist and every request is rejected.
 * That env stays available for its other legitimate uses (auth redirects
 * etc.) — it must simply never be used to build media URLs.
 *
 * The agent RUNTIME persist paths never call this resolver: they run without
 * an HTTP request, so they persist references that carry no origin at all.
 * `classroom-media-bytes.ts` writes a RELATIVE `/api/classroom-media/...`
 * path, and `generate-image.ts` / `generate-video.ts` write the id the asset
 * pool allocated (#1522). Both stay valid no matter which origin serves the
 * app.

 * Final fallback origin when nothing is threaded and no request exists.
 *
 * Deliberately a local dev origin, NOT `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIN_SITE_ORIGIN`: in a
 * background/agent-runner context with no origin captured yet, the only
 * same-origin-safe guess is this app's own localhost. Production deployments
 * always thread a real origin (request-derived, or persisted at session
 * creation), so this fallback only ever fires in dev/tests. The agent
 * runtime's own persist paths do not use this resolver at all — they persist
 * relative references (see the module comment).
