/**
 * Assert that @openmaic/storage's PostgreSQL contract suites really exercised a
 * real PostgreSQL, from evidence that cannot be produced by editing the tests.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The suites already refuse to skip when
 * STORAGE_PG_CONTRACT_REQUIRED=1, but that refusal is a `throw` inside the test
 * modules, so it cannot fire if vitest stops collecting them. Collection is
 * decided by `packages/@openmaic/storage/vitest.config.ts`, and both that file
 * and the whole `test/` directory are on the ignore list of publishable inputs
 * in `check-package-version-bumps.mjs`. The entire surface those suites live on
 * can therefore be rewritten with no version bump and no release gate noticing.
 *
 * WHY THE VITEST RESULTS ARE NOT ENOUGH ON THEIR OWN. `assertionResults` are
 * test CASES, not `expect()` calls, so a file named `pg-document-store.pg.test.ts`
 * containing nothing but `test('x', () => {})` satisfies every check in phase 1
 * below. And because `test/setup.ts` is already wired as `setupFiles`, a single
 * `vi.mock('pg', ...)` there makes every suite collect, run and pass green
 * against an in-memory fake. Both edits are one line, in `test/`, and need no
 * version bump. Phase 1 therefore proves only that files with those names ran
 * and reported passing cases — nothing whatsoever about a database.
 *
 * WHAT PHASE 2 ADDS. It connects to the contract database from OUTSIDE the
 * vitest process and asks PostgreSQL itself what happened: every table these
 * backends own must exist, and each must have gained inserts DURING the run.
 * Nothing inside `test/` can forge that, because producing it requires
 * actually writing to the database this script independently connects to.
 *
 * Insert counters rather than surviving rows: the suites clean up after
 * themselves, so counting rows would prove nothing, while `n_tup_ins` survives
 * the cleanup. Counted as a delta against a baseline captured before the run
 * rather than as an absolute, so a non-ephemeral database cannot satisfy the
 * check forever on the strength of some earlier run. Both current workflows use
 * a fresh per-job service container, but this check should not depend on that
 * staying true.
 *
 * ── THREAT MODEL, STATED HONESTLY ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * What this proves: during this run, rows were inserted into every one of
 * those tables in a real PostgreSQL, and files with the contract suites' names
 * ran and passed.
 *
 * What it does NOT prove: that the built `PgDocumentStore`, `PgRuntimeStore`
 * and `PgAssetStore` were the code that inserted them. The whole `test/` directory is on the
 * publishable-input ignore list, so test code can create the schema and insert
 * directly, and this audit would read the same either way. Closing that needs a
 * harness living outside the ignored `test/` surface — separate work, not
 * attempted here.
 *
 * That limit is acceptable because of who each threat is. This guard exists to
 * catch ACCIDENTAL silencing: a vitest `include`/`exclude` change, a missing
 * environment variable, a renamed suite file, a dropped workflow step. Those
 * are the ways this coverage actually disappears, and they are all caught.
 * It is not a defence against someone deliberately faking coverage from inside
 * `test/` — and it does not need to be, because that person can merge changes
 * to the production sources just as easily.
