/**
 * The one list of owned, publishable @openmaic packages.
 *
 * Several checks and the release workflow each used to carry their own copy of
 * this list, which meant a package missing from one of them was silently exempt
 * from that check rather than failing anything. The scripts now share this
 * module; the workflow cannot import JavaScript into its `on:` trigger, so
 * {@link assertPackageListIsComplete} verifies from the outside that the
 * workflow's own list still agrees with this one.
 *
 * Ordered by dependency: dsl first, followed by its dependents.
 *
 * ── THREAT MODEL FOR EVERY GATE THAT READS THIS ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * This list, and the checks built on it, are configuration held in the same
 * repository as the code they check. Anyone who can merge a change to
 * `scripts/` can also edit the gate itself: shorten this list, relax a rule,
 * delete a workflow step. No amount of additional checking closes that, because
 * every new check arrives with its own editable configuration.
 *
 * That is fine, because it is not the threat these gates are for. They exist to
 * catch MISTAKES — a package added in one place and forgotten in another, a
 * dependency range that publishes differently from how it reads, a test suite
 * that stops running without anyone noticing. Those are silent by default and
 * expensive to find later, which is exactly what a gate is good at. Deliberate
 * subversion is not in scope and cannot be: someone willing to edit these
 * scripts to hide a change can edit the production sources directly, and code
 * review, not tooling, is what stands in the way of that.

 * are stripped first, so a commented-out trigger path no longer satisfies the
 * check while quietly disabling a package's release; and each enumeration is
 * compared as a SET, so an unexpected entry fails as well as a missing one.
 *
 * WHAT IT COVERS, and therefore what it does not. Two enumerations are read as
 * exact sets: the `on.push.paths` trigger, and every `for pkg in ...;` loop
 * (the build, pack, publish and tag loops). `--filter "@openmaic/<name>"` is
 * checked more loosely — every package must appear as a filter somewhere, and
 * no filter may name an unknown package — because individual steps legitimately
 * filter subsets, as the typecheck step does by omitting importer. A textual
 * check cannot tell a deliberate subset from an accidental one; converting the
 * workflow to a matrix would, and is a larger change than this.
