/**
 * RuntimeStore — the persistence contract for the learner-runtime layer
 * (#869): `RuntimeSession`s (identity + lifecycle, partitioned by
 * `(stageId, learnerKey)`) and their append-only `RuntimeRecord`s.
 *
 * The mirror of {@link DocumentStore} for the runtime quadrant of the storage
 * RFC, with the differences the envelope forces:
 *
 * - **Multi-tenant**: a document has ONE stored aggregate; a stage has MANY
 *   runtime sessions — one or more per `(learnerKey, kind)`. Every LISTING is
 *   therefore partition-scoped — there is deliberately no global listing;
 *   single-session operations are id-keyed, and {@link RuntimeStore.mergeLearner}
 *   is the one deliberate cross-stage sweep (the sign-in migration).
 * - **The store owns the version stamp.** The runtime line has no unversioned
 *   epoch, so `createSession` takes {@link RuntimeSessionInit} (no stamp) and
 *   the store stamps `RUNTIME_DSL_VERSION` itself. No code path persists an
 *   unstamped session.
 * - **Records are not independently versioned** — the version rides the parent
 *   session; records are ordered facts under it, `seq` assigned by the store.
 *
 * Payload internals are app-owned: per-kind validators are injected like
 * scene-content validators on DocumentStore, defaulting to the DSL skeleton
 * guards for the skeleton kinds (`chat`, `quizAttempt`).
