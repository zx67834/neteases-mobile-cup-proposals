/**
 * Document -> asset reference maintenance.
 *
 * **Internal to the package.** These are transaction-scoped maintenance
 * primitives, not API: called outside a document write they would replace or
 * delete reference rows nothing else knows about. The supported switches are
 * `PgDocumentStoreOptions.trackAssetReferences` and
 * `AssetCollectorOptions.documentReferences`; nothing here is re-exported
 * from the package root.
 *
 * This module is the only place that maintains `document_asset_refs` and the
 * lifecycle columns on `asset_entries` **as part of a document write**. Two
 * other writers exist by design and are named so this docstring cannot go
 * stale: `PgAssetStore.put` writes all three lifecycle columns when it
 * allocates an entry, and `AssetCollector` marks legacy entries and deletes
 * released ones. Everything here takes a `Queryable` and runs inside a
 * transaction the caller already owns -- the document store's write
 * transactions and the collector's backfill -- so a reference row and the
 * document write that implies it commit or roll back together. There is no
 * HTTP route and no scheduled walk over documents.
 *
 * Two halves, deliberately separated:
 *
 * - The **pure** half turns a document, a single scene, or a stage into the
 *   candidate references of one scope, using the DSL's own enumerator. It is
 *   the same enumeration exports use, so a slot the DSL learns about arrives
 *   here for free.
 * - The **SQL** half replaces the rows of one scope and stamps the lifecycle
 *   columns of the entries that gained or lost their last reference.
 *
 * A scope is `(stage_id, scope, scene_id)`: `scope = 'stage'` is the
 * stage-level slot -- stage whiteboards and the stage video manifest, which no
 * scene owns -- and `scope = 'scene'` is one scene's own slots. The
 * distinction is a column rather than a reserved `scene_id` value because
 * scene ids are opaque: a scene whose id matched the sentinel would share a
 * key with the stage-level rows, and whichever scope was written second would
 * silently delete the other's rows and stamp its entries unreferenced.
 * Scopes match the granularity of the document store's writes: `putScene`
 * touches one scene's rows, `putStage` the stage-level rows, a full save all
 * of them. That is not a detail: the media write-back path writes scenes and
 * stages incrementally, so a full-save-only hook would miss exactly the writes
 * that name freshly allocated ids.
 *
 * **Ids are opaque.** A candidate becomes a row only when `asset_entries`
 * already holds an entry with that id, established by a join in the caller's
 * transaction. Nothing here parses, validates, or prefix-matches a reference:
 * placeholders, `data:` payloads, legacy URLs and ids from other id spaces
 * simply produce no row, which is the same rule the read paths apply when they
 * answer "unknown id" with a miss.

 * Take, in ONE ascending statement, every entry row lock the calling

 * works only if it is complete and first. Two writers that each acquire their
 * rows in one ascending sequence can never hold what the other wants; two
 * writers that acquire in several sequences can, whatever each sequence is
 * ordered by. That is not hypothetical: a full save writes one `INSERT INTO
 * document_asset_refs` per scope, each of which makes the foreign key take
 * `KEY SHARE` on the entries it names, so before this call existed a save
 * acquired entry locks in scope order and could deadlock the collector's
 * ascending legacy mark. Hence the rule every caller here follows:
 *
 * > Lock the union of every id the transaction will touch -- the ids it is
 * > about to reference AND the ids it is about to stop referencing -- in
 * > ascending order, before the first statement that writes
 * > `document_asset_refs` or `asset_entries`.
 *
 * After that, the per-scope inserts' `KEY SHARE`, the commit `UPDATE` and the
 * stamp `UPDATE` all touch rows this transaction already holds a lock on at
 * least that strength, so none of them waits inside `asset_entries` again.
 *
 * The order is `ORDER BY id` in SQL rather than the order of the parameter
 * array, so the database's collation decides it and every locking statement in
 * this package agrees -- the collector's legacy mark
 * (`AssetCollector.markLegacyBatch`) and its backfill included.
 *
 * Strength: `no-key-update` for a write that will update lifecycle columns,
 * which is exactly what its `UPDATE`s take by themselves -- so this fixes the
 * order without blocking anything that was not already blocked. `key-share`
 * for the collector's insert-only backfill, which is exactly what its inserts'
