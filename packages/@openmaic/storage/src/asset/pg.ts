/**
 * PostgreSQL registry for server assets over a pluggable byte layer.
 *
 * Within a write, the blob row is claimed first, then the bytes are written,
 * then the entry that references them. The order is load-bearing at both ends:
 * claiming the row first serializes the write against the collector, which
 * could otherwise delete those bytes while this upsert waited for the lock, and
 * writing bytes before the entry keeps every surviving entry backed by bytes
 * that were actually stored. The byte write is unconditional, so both existence
 * paths emit the same statements.
 *
 * The byte write itself must go through the transaction-pinned queryable
 * (`writeWith`) whenever the bytes live in the registry's own PostgreSQL:
 * written on the byte layer's own pooled connection while this transaction
 * holds the blob-row lock, it would block on that lock forever -- a
 * self-deadlock PostgreSQL cannot detect. A byte layer that cannot join the
 * transaction must declare `writesOutsideRegistryDatabase`, or the registry
 * refuses the configuration (see `assertByteWriteIsCoordinatable`).
 *
 * Request paths never delete bytes; the offline collector is the only reclaimer.
 * `withTransaction` must pin all queries in its body to one freshly checked-out
 * transaction.

/**
 * One PGlite-compatible statement per entry, in dependency order.
 *
 * The three lifecycle columns on `asset_entries` and the `document_asset_refs`
 * table carry the entry level of reference counting, mirroring one level up
 * what `asset_blobs.unreferenced_at` already does for bytes:
 *
 * - `expires_at` is set when an entry is allocated and cleared when a document
 *   first names it. An entry no document ever names therefore has a deadline
 *   rather than living forever.
 * - `committed_at` is stamped by that same first document write. `NULL` means
 *   pending; it is never read on a request path.
 * - `unreferenced_at` is stamped when a document write removes the entry's
 *   last reference row, so an entry drains after a grace period instead of
 *   immediately, and cleared by the document write paths when a reference
 *   arrives back. The collector's backfill is the one reference-adding writer
 *   that does NOT clear it: it deliberately touches no lifecycle column, so a
 *   walk that re-references a stamped entry leaves it referenced AND stamped.
 *   That is a normal intermediate state and a safe one -- the entry pass never
 *   releases a referenced entry, and the next document write to that document
 *   normalizes the columns.
 *
 * `document_asset_refs.scope` separates the stage-level slot -- stage
 * whiteboards and the stage video manifest, which no scene owns -- from a
 * scene's own slots, and is part of the primary key. It is a column rather
 * than a reserved `scene_id` value because scene ids are opaque and
 * unconstrained: a scene whose id happened to equal any sentinel would
 * otherwise share a key with the stage-level rows, and one scope's write
 * would silently delete the other's. Stage rows carry `scene_id = ''`, which
 * is then a value nothing keys on rather than a reservation.
 *
 * The table deliberately carries no foreign key to `document_stages`: the
 * document schema is a different backend that a deployment may not provision
 * at all, and the reference rows are maintained explicitly by the document
 * store (see `./references.ts`) rather than by a cascade.
 *
 * `asset_reference_tracking` is a one-row marker, written by a document store
 * configured to maintain references and read by the collector before its
 * entry pass. It exists because the two halves are separately configured and
 * the failure mode of enabling only the second is silent deletion of live
 * media: an empty `document_asset_refs` cannot be told apart from documents
 * that reference nothing, but the absence of this marker can.
 *
 * `document_asset_withdrawals` records that a host has retired a document
 * while keeping its rows, so the collector's one-time backfill does not walk
 * that document's stored JSON and re-reference what the retirement released.
 * A row here is the only durable trace of a retirement -- the document itself
 * looks exactly like a live one, by design, because the retirement belongs to
 * the host's own tombstone and not to this schema -- and therefore the only
 * thing that may make that walk skip a document. Every write path that
 * maintains references removes the row -- a write that re-establishes the
 * document's references, and a delete on a store that tracks them -- so under
 * a single, consistent configuration the record never outlives what it
 * describes. A delete issued by a store with tracking OFF cannot clear it,
 * because that store may be running against a database with no asset schema
 * at all; a stale record then survives its document and would make the walk
 * skip whatever later claims that id. That is one more reason for the rule
 * `docs/reference-server.md` already gives: do not mix tracking states on one
 * database (see `./references.ts`).
