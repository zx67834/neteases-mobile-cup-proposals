/**
 * The pluggable byte layer beneath a server asset registry.
 *
 * The registry — ids, owners, media types, metadata, and the reference count —
 * always lives in a transactional store. The bytes do not have to: they may sit
 * in a column of that store, or in an object store addressed by content hash.
 * Two implementations ship, which is why this interface exists at all. An
 * interface with one implementation is not a seam, and this package has removed
 * one such seam before rather than carry it.
 *
 * What makes the layer separable is that **reclamation is offline**. If a
 * request could delete bytes, a concurrent write deduplicating onto those same
 * bytes could commit against them, and a byte layer outside the registry's
 * transaction would have no way to serialize the two — which is exactly what
 * would force bytes into that transaction. With collection moved out of every
 * request path, what remains is an ordering rule rather than an atomicity one:
 *
 * - bytes are written **before** the row that references them, so a crash
 *   between the two costs storage and loses nothing (the reverse order would
 *   leave a registry entry pointing at bytes that were never stored);
 * - bytes are deleted **after** the last row referencing them, and only by the
 *   offline collector;
 * - the reference count and the decision to collect are serialized on the blob
 *   row, which every implementation keeps regardless of where bytes live.
 *
 * Note what this interface deliberately does not have: no reference counting,
 * no ownership, no deduplication decision. Those belong to the registry. A byte
 * layer stores and returns bytes under a hash and knows nothing about who
 * references them, which is what keeps the global byte pool free of principals.
