  /**
   * The entry level: backfill what the reference table is missing, then

   *
   * Three invariants hold this together, and each is enforced below rather
   * than assumed:
   *
   * (i)   **Nothing is released while any legacy entry exists.** A legacy
   *       entry -- one written before the lifecycle columns existed, so
   *       `committed_at` and `expires_at` are both NULL -- has no reference
   *       rows either, which would make it look eligible while documents still
   *       name it. The gate is re-asked of the database on every pass rather
   *       than remembered, so it cannot be defeated by a restart or by a
   *       deployment that briefly wrote with older code.
   * (ii)  **Legacy entries are marked committed only after every
   *       `document_stages` row has been enumerated.** The walk is bounded per
   *       pass and resumable, and only the pass that reaches its end marks.
   * (iii) **A marked legacy entry that no document names gets
   *       `unreferenced_at = now()`,** not a backdated stamp, so it drains
   *       after the grace period rather than on the same pass -- which leaves
   *       a window for a document write, an undo or a restore to claim it
   *       back.
   *
   * The mark is itself batched (see {@link markLegacyEntries}), and that
   * cannot weaken any of the three. Each batch marks and stamps the same rows
   * in one transaction, so (iii) holds per batch rather than only at the end,
   * and a batch that fails leaves its rows legacy -- which keeps (i)'s gate
   * shut, because the gate is re-asked of the database on this pass and every
   * later one. The gate opens only once NO legacy row is left, which is after
   * the last batch has both marked and stamped; there is no window in which
   * the gate is open over a row that is committed but not yet considered for a

   * Stamp one bounded batch of committed entries that no document references.

   * This is the standing counterpart of the legacy mark's per-batch stamp, and
   * it exists because that one cannot reach every row that needs stamping.
   * The document store stamps an entry the moment a write drops its last
   * reference, which covers everything that happens through a write. What it
   * cannot cover is a reference row that went missing WITHOUT such a write:
   * rows removed out of band, or a restore that reinstated documents but not
   * the reference table. Such an entry is committed, unstamped and referenced
   * by nothing, and nothing else in the system would ever look at it again --
   * `releaseEntries` takes only entries with `expires_at` or `unreferenced_at`
   * set, and the blob pass refuses a blob any entry still names. The entry,
   * its bytes and its share of the principal's quota would be held forever.
   *
   * NOT a repair for a mixed tracking state, which is the opposite shape and
   * is worth naming so this is not read as covering it. A `deleteDocument`
   * issued by a store with `trackAssetReferences` off deletes the document
   * rows and nothing else -- `document_asset_refs` has no foreign key to
   * `document_stages` -- so that document's reference rows OUTLIVE it. The
   * entry stays referenced, by rows naming a stage that is gone, which is the
   * state this sweep skips by design and nothing in this package reclaims.
   * `docs/reference-server.md` says why the answer is to roll
   * `trackAssetReferences` and `documentReferences` back together rather than
   * to have the collector guess.
   *
   * Gated on the legacy gate being open, which is invariant (i) again rather
   * than caution: while the walk is unfinished the reference table is a subset
   * of the truth, so "no reference row" does not yet mean "no document names
   * it", and stamping on that basis would start a grace period for media a
   * document still holds.
   *
   * ONE batch per pass, `batchSize` rows, paged by an ascending id cursor that
   * wraps to the start when it reaches the end. The cursor lives in memory,
   * like {@link backfillCursor}: a restart re-walks from the start, which is
   * free because the work is idempotent -- a row already stamped no longer
   * matches the predicate, and a row that gained a reference is skipped by the
   * `NOT EXISTS`. The cost is the honest one: every pass locks one bounded,
   * ascending batch of LIVE entry rows for the length of one short
   * transaction, so a concurrent save touching one of them queues behind it,
   * bounded by that transaction rather than by the table. An orphan therefore
   * becomes a release candidate within `ceil(entries / batchSize)` passes
   * rather than never.
   *
   * The two statements are the same discipline as everywhere else in this
   * file: lock the batch ascending with `FOR UPDATE` (the strength that
   * conflicts with an insert-only reference writer's `KEY SHARE`), then stamp
   * in a separate statement whose fresh READ COMMITTED snapshot sees any
   * reference row that committed while the lock was being waited for.

  /**
   * Mark the legacy entries committed, then stamp the marked ones no document
   * names -- in bounded batches, never in one transaction over the table.
   *
   * ## Why batches
   *
   * The unbatched form locked every legacy row and then every committed,
   * unstamped row -- that is every healthy entry on the deployment -- in one
   * transaction, and held those locks for as long as the slowest of them took
   * to acquire. Two consequences, both real on a busy deployment and both in
   * the upgrade window rather than in steady state:
   *
   * - Every document write touching an existing entry queued behind it, up to
   *   the `lock_timeout` budget, and a user save that hit the budget failed
   *   with a lock-timeout error the app's HTTP layer does not retry.
   * - The mark held rows it had already locked while it waited for the next,
   *   so it could take part in a lock cycle with a concurrent save's
   *   `commitReferencedEntries` and be chosen, or make the save be chosen, as
   *   the deadlock victim.
   *
   * A batch takes at most `batchSize` row locks, in ascending id order, and
   * commits. A concurrent save can still contend for the rows of the batch in
   * flight, and either side may still hit `lock_timeout` -- what changes is
   * that the wait is bounded by one batch rather than by the whole table, and
   * that a batch which fails costs only itself.
   *
   * ## Why one transaction per batch marks AND stamps
   *
   * Because that is what makes the work resumable from the DATABASE rather
   * than from memory. A row this transaction does not reach stays legacy, so
   * invariant (i) keeps the gate shut, `hasLegacyEntries` still says so on the
   * next pass, and the walk-then-mark runs again and continues where the
   * failure left it. Nothing is remembered between passes and nothing is
   * undone: what a batch marked stays marked, and what it stamped stays
   * stamped, so a lock timeout can never leave the legacy gate closed forever
   * or lose a stamp.
   *
   * Marking and stamping in two separate walks was the other candidate. It
   * fails exactly there: once the marking walk finished, the last legacy row
   * would be gone and with it the only durable record that the stamping walk
   * still had rows to visit, so a stamping walk interrupted half way would
   * simply never resume, and the entries it had not reached -- committed,
   * referenced by nothing, never stamped -- would never become release
   * candidates at all.
   *
   * ## The three statements per batch
   *
   * (1) Lock this batch's ids with `FOR UPDATE`, ascending, re-checking the
   *     legacy predicate. `FOR UPDATE` rather than the `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` an
   *     `UPDATE` takes by itself, because only `FOR UPDATE` conflicts with the
   *     `KEY SHARE` an insert into `document_asset_refs` takes on the entry it
   *     names: an `UPDATE … WHERE NOT EXISTS (refs)` would neither wait for a
   *     concurrent insert-only reference writer nor see it, and would stamp an
   *     entry a backfill on another instance had just given a reference. That
   *     is not a loss (`releaseEntries` re-checks references before deleting
   *     anything), but it under-counts the principal's live bytes and starts a
   *     grace period that should not have started.
   *
   *     Ascending order is what makes a concurrent writer QUEUE rather than
   *     deadlock, and that only holds because every other writer in this
   *     package acquires the entries of one transaction in one ascending
   *     statement too: a document write through `references.ts` takes the
   *     union of the ids it will reference and the ids it will stop
   *     referencing up front (`lockEntriesInOrder`), and the backfill takes
   *     the union of one document's ids at `FOR KEY SHARE`
   *     (`lockBackfillEntries`) before its per-scope inserts. Ordering one
   *     side alone would not have been enough, and was not: while a save still
   *     took its foreign-key `KEY SHARE` locks one scope at a time, a save
   *     whose first scope named a higher id than its second could hold what
   *     this batch wanted and then wait for what this batch held. The residual
   *     is now a writer outside this discipline -- anything that locks several
   *     `asset_entries` rows in more than one statement, or in another order.
   *
   *     Re-checking the predicate under the lock is what keeps a row a
   *     concurrent save committed between the candidate query and the lock out
   *     of the batch entirely: such a row is referenced by that save, so it
   *     must be neither counted nor stamped here.
   *
   * (2) Mark the locked ids committed. Separate from the stamp rather than one
   *     data-modifying CTE: PostgreSQL does not support updating the same row
   *     twice in one statement, and every row this marks is a row the stamp
   *     may touch.
   *
   * (3) Stamp, restricted to the ids just locked and to the ones no document
   *     references. A separate statement takes a fresh snapshot under READ
   *     COMMITTED, so it sees any reference row that committed while (1) was
   *     waiting, and the locks held since (1) keep a later one from arriving.
   *
   * The stamp here reaches exactly the rows this batch marked, which is
   * narrower than the predicate the unbatched form used ("every committed,
   * unstamped, unreferenced entry"). The rest of that breadth has NOT been
   * dropped -- it moved to {@link stampUnreferencedSweep}, which runs on every
   * pass instead of only on the one that finishes the walk. It had to move
   * rather than stay here: a row this predicate cannot match is a row no
   * number of later passes would reach, because once the last legacy row is
   * marked this function is never called again.
   *
   * ## Termination
   *
   * The loop runs until no legacy candidate is left, rather than stopping
   * after a fixed number of batches and reporting a cap. Stopping early would
   * leave legacy rows behind, and invariant (i) would then hold the entry
   * level shut for another whole interval -- which is the deferral this
   * rework exists to prevent -- while making the next pass repeat the document
   * walk before it could continue. It terminates because nothing creates
   * legacy rows: `PgAssetStore.put` writes all three lifecycle columns, so the
   * candidate set only shrinks, by this loop or by a concurrent save that
   * commits one of them.

          // entry row but never updates it. A `NOT EXISTS` folded into the

          // when the backfill commits, find the entry row unchanged, and keep
          // the answer it computed from its own statement-start snapshot --
          // "no reference" -- while a committed reference row existed. The
          // entry would be deleted and the cascade would take the backfill's
          // row with it, leaving a document naming bytes that are gone. Under
          // READ COMMITTED a separate statement takes a fresh snapshot, so it
          // sees that row. (Two collector instances are needed to reach this:
          // one instance runs its backfill and its entry pass in sequence.)

          // answer stay true: a reference insert arriving after it needs
          // `KEY SHARE` on this row and blocks until this transaction ends.
