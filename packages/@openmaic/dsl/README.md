# @openmaic/dsl

The **contract keystone** of the MAIC SDK family. `@openmaic/dsl` is *pure spec* — the
slide object-model types, build-time JSON Schema artifacts, pure validators / type-guards,
and version/migration helpers — with **zero runtime dependencies** (no React, no
pptx, no echarts).

That purity is the whole point: the renderer, the importer, and any future
package can depend on `@openmaic/dsl` without pulling in junk.

## Dependency arrows (acyclic)

```
@openmaic/dsl       ->  (nothing)
@openmaic/renderer  ->  @openmaic/dsl
@openmaic/importer  ->  @openmaic/dsl
@openmaic/exporter  ->  @openmaic/dsl     (reserved, future)
```

`@openmaic/dsl` is the only package everything else depends on, and it depends on
nothing.

## What's in here

| Module        | Contents                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slides.ts`   | The slide object model: `Slide`, `PPTElement` and all variants, theme, background, animation, table/chart/code types, plus `ElementTypes` / `ShapePathFormulasKeys` enums. |
| `stage.ts`    | The lesson skeleton: `Stage`, generic `Scene<TAction, TContent>`, `SceneType`, `StageMode`, `Whiteboard`, `VideoManifest`, `SlideContent`, `QuizContent`, `MultiAgentConfig`, `GeneratedAgentConfig`, plus `isSlideContent` / `isQuizContent` guards. |
| `action.ts`   | The playback verb set: `Action` and all variants (spotlight, laser, speech, the `Wb*` whiteboard family, `play_video`, `discussion`, and the `widget_*` interaction actions), `ActionType`, the frozen `ACTION_TYPES` set + `isActionType` guard, the `FIRE_AND_FORGET_ACTIONS` / `SLIDE_ONLY_ACTIONS` / `SYNC_ACTIONS` category lists, plus the `PercentageGeometry` overlay type. |
| `guards.ts`   | Pure discriminant type-guards (`isTextElement`, …) and `PPT_ELEMENT_TYPES`. |
| `validate.ts` | Pure, zero-dep structural validators — `validateStage` / `validateScene` / `validateAction` returning an error-collecting `ValidationResult`. |
| `normalize.ts` | Pure, zero-dep defaulters — `normalizeElement` / `normalizeSlide` / `normalizeScene` / `normalizeStage` and the canonical `ELEMENT_DEFAULTS`. Fills required-field defaults, derives geometry, fails loud on malformed input; the repair counterpart to `validate*`. `normalizeSlideWith({ onInvalid: 'drop', onDropped })` builds a map-safe `normalizeSlide` variant so producers normalizing wild-world input (imported decks, model output) can degrade per element instead of failing the document; `normalizeSlide` itself stays unary (`slides.map(normalizeSlide)` keeps working). |
| `asset-manifest.ts` | Pure document asset enumeration: `enumerateAssetManifest`, `AssetManifest`, entry kinds and optional caller-supplied metadata enrichment. |
| `slide-media-slots.ts` | Canonical read-only role descriptors for every media-bearing slide slot. |
| `version.ts`  | Serialized-contract version + migration registry: `DSL_VERSION`, the `DSL_MIGRATIONS` ladder, and the pure `migrate` / `dslVersionOf` / `needsMigration` runner. |

```ts
import type { Slide, PPTElement, Action } from '@openmaic/dsl';
import { isTextElement, DSL_VERSION, SYNC_ACTIONS } from '@openmaic/dsl';
```

## Asset manifest (0.10)

`enumerateAssetManifest(document, options?)` is the standard, IO-free answer to
which asset references a stage document touches. It walks stage whiteboards,
scene canvases, scene whiteboards, speech actions, and video-manifest keys. It
recognizes slide backgrounds; image, audio, and video sources; video
`mediaRef`s and posters; and speech `audioId`s.

```ts
import {
  enumerateAssetManifest,
  type AssetManifest,
  type AssetManifestMetadata,
} from '@openmaic/dsl';

const manifest: AssetManifest = enumerateAssetManifest(document, {
  metadata(ref, kind): AssetManifestMetadata | undefined {
    return metadataAlreadyKnownByTheCaller(ref, kind);
  },
});
```

`manifest.entries` contains one entry per distinct `(ref, kind)` pair in
first-occurrence document order. If one ref appears in several roles, each role
gets its own entry; the first occurrence of each pair fixes its deterministic
ordering slot without losing ownership information.
Optional metadata (`byteSize`, `mimeType`, `durationSeconds`, `voice`, and
`prompt`) is copied from the callback once per distinct `(ref, kind)` pair. The enumerator
itself performs no IO and never mutates the document. The callback is an
explicit caller boundary: it may consult caller-owned state, but it must not
mutate the document.

`manifest.referenceCounts` counts logical owners, not raw slots. A video
element using the same ref in both `src` and `mediaRef` is one owner; its poster
is separate. Owner keys use traversal positions rather than user-controlled
scene, slide, element, or action IDs, so duplicate IDs do not collapse distinct
owners. Consumers deciding whether bytes may be replaced in place should use
these counts instead of rebuilding an ID-keyed walk.

## Runtime layer (schema + validators + normalizers)

The contract is enforceable two ways — a zero-dependency in-process validator
and a cross-language JSON Schema — both generated from / aligned to the same
public TS types, and both honoring the zero-runtime-dependency invariant; a
third zero-dependency `normalize*` family repairs a document to satisfy them:

1. **JSON Schema artifacts (cross-language mirror)** — `Stage`, the default
   `Scene<Action, SceneContent>`, and `Action` are emitted as standalone JSON
   Schema at build time and shipped. This is the language-neutral mirror of the
   contract for non-TS consumers, and the place to go for exhaustive value-level
   (type / format) checking:

   ```ts
   import stageSchema from '@openmaic/dsl/schema/stage.schema.json' with { type: 'json' };
   import sceneSchema from '@openmaic/dsl/schema/scene.schema.json' with { type: 'json' };
   import actionSchema from '@openmaic/dsl/schema/action.schema.json' with { type: 'json' };
   // feed to any JSON Schema validator (ajv, or a non-TS / non-JS consumer)
   ```

   The schema is generated from the TS types (the single source of truth) by
   `ts-json-schema-generator`, a **devDependency** — it never enters the runtime
   dependency set.

2. **Pure validators (in-process boundary)** — `validate*` are hand-written,
   zero-dependency checks layered on the guards: object shape, required fields
   (including each action variant's, e.g. a `spotlight`'s `elementId`), known
   discriminants, and the scene `type` <-> `content` binding the public `Scene`
   type enforces. Because they add no dependency, in-process (TS / JS) producers
   and consumers — generators, importers, the runtime engine — can rely on them
   directly without shipping a schema validator. They are a structural subset of
   the schema (presence + discriminants; the schema additionally checks each
   field's value shape), and describe the same contract. Both are kept in lockstep
   by a test that pins the validators' per-variant required fields to the
   generated schema.

   ```ts
   import { validateStage, validateScene, validateAction } from '@openmaic/dsl';

   const result = validateScene(input);
   if (!result.valid) throw new Error(result.errors.map((e) => `${e.path}: ${e.message}`).join('; '));
   ```

   `ValidationResult` is `{ valid: true } | { valid: false; errors: { path; message }[] }` —
   it collects every issue rather than failing on the first.

3. **Pure normalizers (repair boundary)** — where `validate*` *reports* on a
   document, `normalize*` *repairs* one, so producers stop carrying their own
   imperative "fix up the output" pass. `normalizeElement` (and the
   `normalizeSlide` / `normalizeScene` / `normalizeStage` walkers) fill the
   required fields a producer may have left off, derive geometry-dependent fields
   (a line's `start` / `end`, a shape's `viewBox` / `path`), and **fail loud** on
   a present-but-wrong-typed field — returning a fully-defaulted document that
   then satisfies the validators. Pure and non-mutating; idempotent.

   The *static* defaults (`ELEMENT_DEFAULTS`) are the single source of truth and
   also ride out on the JSON Schema as `@default` annotations (so non-TS
   consumers ship them too); a test pins the two together. `normalize*` owns only
   the producer-independent defaults — media-specific reconciliation (e.g.
   fitting an image box to a resolved asset's real dimensions) stays a producer
   concern.

   Scope: `normalize*` owns element **content** (the per-variant required fields
   + derivable geometry). It does **not** fill or check the base identity /
   geometry every element shares (`id`, `left` / `top` / `width` / `height` /
   `rotate`) — those are producer-supplied (the `id` is often assigned
   downstream) and carry no content default. `normalize*` and `validate*` are
   complementary: normalize repairs content, validate / the schema check the
   full structure.

   ```ts
   import { normalizeElement, normalizeScene, ELEMENT_DEFAULTS } from '@openmaic/dsl';

   const el = normalizeElement(rawElement); // required fields filled, geometry derived
   const scene = normalizeScene(rawScene); //  walks the slide canvas + whiteboards
   ```

## Version & migration

Two version numbers live in this package and do **not** track each other:

- the **npm package version** (`package.json`) — the semver of the *code/API*
  artifact; bumps when exports or behavior change.
- **`DSL_VERSION`** — the version of the *serialized* slide contract (the
  on-disk document shape). It bumps only when a persisted document's shape
  changes, independent of package releases. (A third, finer axis —
  `SlideContent.schemaVersion` — versions the PPTist canvas *inside* a slide and
  is migrated app-side; it is orthogonal to `DSL_VERSION`.)

`version.ts` owns the document-level migration mechanism, zero-dependency and
pure like the validators:

```ts
import { DSL_VERSION, migrate, dslVersionOf, needsMigration } from '@openmaic/dsl';

const current = migrate(doc); // walks doc from its written version up to DSL_VERSION
```

- `DSL_MIGRATIONS` is an ordered ladder of `{ from, to, migrate }` steps; each
  step's `to` is the next step's `from`, and the last reaches `DSL_VERSION`.
- `migrate(doc)` reads the document's version from its `dslVersion` envelope
  field (absent ⇒ treated as legacy/unversioned), walks the ladder applying each
  pure transform, and stamps the result. It is **idempotent** (a current
  document is returned as-is), **forward-compatible** (a document stamped newer
  than `DSL_VERSION` is returned untouched, never silently downgraded), and
  **fail-loud** (a gap in the ladder throws rather than yielding a half-migrated
  document).

The first ladder entry is a no-op transform that stamps legacy documents up to
the current `DSL_VERSION`: promoting `Action` into the contract and adding
validators did not change any serialized shape, so the current on-disk shape
already *is* `0.1.0`. The entry wires the pipeline end to end and gives real
documents a version to migrate forward from; the first real transform is
appended (and `DSL_VERSION` bumped) when the serialized shape first changes.

Promoting `interactive` and `pbl` into the contract does **not** bump
`DSL_VERSION`: it widens accepted content without changing stored bytes or the
meaning of an existing field. This follows the additive-field precedent in
the `GeneratedAgentConfig` compatibility note in `stage.ts`; schema-pinned
consumers still need the new package version to accept documents carrying the
newly described shapes.

Which aggregate carries the `dslVersion` field — a whole `Stage`, a single Scene
row, or a bundle — is left to the store that first consumes this pipeline; the
runner only needs the envelope field.

## Runtime envelope (#869)

Learner-produced runtime data (chat, quiz attempts, playback facts) is persisted
outside the document, per learner, through a `RuntimeStore` (`@openmaic/storage`).
This package owns the envelope: `RuntimeSession` (identity + lifecycle, keyed by
stage/learner/kind) and `RuntimeRecord<TPayload>` (ordered facts; the
store-assigned `seq` is the replay ordering key). Core-kind payload skeletons
(`chat`, `quizAttempt`) live here; payload internals are app-owned, validated at
the store boundary via injected validators (`runtime.ts` guards + `validate.ts`).
A `RuntimeSession` carries its **own** version envelope field,
`runtimeDslVersion` — mechanically disjoint from a document's `dslVersion` — and
rides its **own** version line: `RUNTIME_DSL_VERSION` and a dedicated
`RUNTIME_DSL_MIGRATIONS` ladder, walked by `migrateRuntime` (not `migrate`), with
`runtimeDslVersionOf` / `needsRuntimeMigration` as the runtime-line counterparts
of `dslVersionOf` / `needsMigration`.

Unlike the document line, the runtime line has **no unversioned epoch**. Real
pre-versioning documents exist, so `migrate` lifts an unstamped document from
`UNVERSIONED_DSL_VERSION` via its first ladder entry. Nothing legitimately
predates the runtime envelope, though — it is a brand-new contract, and the
future `RuntimeStore` stamps `RUNTIME_DSL_VERSION` at write time. So a
`RuntimeSession` is **born stamped** (`runtimeDslVersion` is a **required** field,
not optional), `RUNTIME_DSL_MIGRATIONS` ships **empty** (no legacy-lift entry;
the first real runtime shape change appends a step from the pinned
`INITIAL_RUNTIME_DSL_VERSION` and bumps `RUNTIME_DSL_VERSION`), and an unstamped
object reaching any runtime-line function (`migrateRuntime`,
`needsRuntimeMigration`, `runtimeDslVersionOf`) **throws** — it is a misrouted
legacy document or an unstamped producer write, not legacy data to lift.
(Non-objects stay exempt: they are not migratable aggregates and read as
unversioned on every line.) An empty ladder is still fully functional — a
stamped-current session early-returns as already current, and a session stamped
at an unknown older version hits the "no migration path" fail-loud.

The two lines stamp **different fields**, so neither ladder reads the other's
version — but disjoint fields alone are not enough: a session lacking
`dslVersion` would still read as *unversioned* to the document runner and be
lifted onto the wrong line. The **cross-line guard** —
enforced in the shared envelope reader, so the plain `dslVersionOf` /
`runtimeDslVersionOf` reads, the `needs*Migration` predicates, and the runners
all give one answer per envelope — closes this with three-case semantics: (1) own line's stamp present → migrate normally
on the own line, regardless of the other key; (2) both stamps absent → genuine
legacy data, walk the own ladder; (3) own stamp absent but the sibling line's
stamp present → **throw**. Case (3) is undecidable from the envelope — the
other line's aggregate misrouted here is byte-identical to this line's data
carrying a stray foreign stamp; migrating would mangle the former, returning it
unchanged would permanently orphan the latter from its own line — so it is
treated like a malformed stamp and fails loud. `validateRuntimeSession`
likewise rejects a session **missing** its `runtimeDslVersion` (born stamped, no
legacy epoch) and a **stray** `dslVersion` on a session at the door. The runner
mechanism (contiguous ladder, idempotent, forward-compatible, fail-loud) is
shared; only the ladder, target version, own stamp field, and the sibling field
the guard checks differ.

## Status

Both consumers are now wired to `@openmaic/dsl` and no longer vendor their own copy
of the slide types:

- **`@openmaic/importer`**: imports all slide types from `@openmaic/dsl`; vendored
  `openmaic/types/slides.ts` deleted. The importer emits complete DSL `Slide`
  objects directly (the old partial "draft slide" + post-fill step is gone).
- **`@openmaic/renderer`**: imports all slide types from `@openmaic/dsl`; vendored
  `types/slides.ts` deleted. `@openmaic/dsl` is a regular dependency, kept external
  in the rollup build so consumers share one copy. The public
  `@openmaic/renderer/types` surface now re-exports the DSL types.

### Roadmap

- [x] Wire `@openmaic/importer` to import types from `@openmaic/dsl` (vendored copy deleted).
- [x] Wire `@openmaic/renderer` to import types from `@openmaic/dsl` (vendored copy deleted).
- [x] Add the JSON Schema for the slide contract + a pure schema validator
      (build-time `dist/schema/*.json` via a devDep generator; zero-dep
      `validate*` functions). See **Runtime layer** below.
- [x] Promote the `stage` / `scene` / `scene-content` types into the DSL (the
      universal skeleton now lives in `stage.ts`).
- [x] Bring the `Action` playback verb set into the DSL (`action.ts`); the
      widget interaction actions graduated into the contract once they decoupled
      from widget configs, so the standard `Action` union now covers them too.
      `Scene<TAction>` defaults to that union.
- [x] Promote interactive and PBL content into the persisted contract, with a
      minimal widget-config extension point and the PBL design/seed skeleton.
- [x] Activate the migration registry: `version.ts` ships the `DSL_MIGRATIONS`
      ladder and a pure `migrate` runner (idempotent, forward-compatible,
      fail-loud), no longer a stub. See **Version & migration** above.
- [x] Own element defaulting in the contract: `normalize.ts` ships the pure
      `normalize*` family + `ELEMENT_DEFAULTS`, and the static defaults ride out
      on the JSON Schema as `@default` annotations. Producers drop their
      imperative "fix up the output" passes. See **Runtime layer** above.
- [ ] Reserve `@openmaic/exporter` as the 4th family member.

### Stage / Scene split

`stage.ts` owns the **universal lesson skeleton**: `Stage`, the compatibility
default `SceneContent` (`SlideContent | QuizContent`), and a generic

```ts
interface Scene<TAction = Action, TContent extends { type: SceneType } = SlideContent | QuizContent>
```

`TAction` defaults to the contract's standard `Action` union (defined in
`action.ts`), so a scene carries playback actions out of the box; skeleton-only
consumers that reject actions opt out with `Scene<never, …>`. `InteractiveContent`
and `PBLContent` are contract-owned and compose into concrete scene unions through
the generic; apps may also specialize widget configs and action unions:

```ts
import type { Action, InteractiveContent, PBLContent, Scene, SceneContent, WidgetConfigBase } from '@openmaic/dsl';
interface AppWidgetConfig extends WidgetConfigBase { featurePayload?: unknown }
type AppContent = SceneContent | InteractiveContent<AppWidgetConfig> | PBLContent;
type AppScene = Scene<Action, AppContent>;
```

The contract owns `WidgetType`, the minimal `WidgetConfigBase`,
`InteractiveContent`, `PBLContent`, and the design-time `PBLProject` plus its
canonical planner-seeded skeleton. Rich per-widget payloads and PBL learner
runtime overlays stay app-side. The widget actions (`widget_highlight`,
`widget_setState`, …) remain config-free playback verbs in `action.ts`.

## Divergence reconciled (seed provenance)

The seed is the app's `lib/types/slides.ts`, but before this package existed the
contract had been copy-pasted into three places that **drifted apart**. This
package is the **canonical superset**: every field that existed in any copy is
kept, so consumers can adopt the DSL without losing data. Merged-in fields are
annotated `@since-merge` in `slides.ts`.

| Field                                   | app `lib/types` | renderer copy | importer copy | DSL decision |
| --------------------------------------- | :-------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | ------------ |
| `PPTTextElement.vAlign`                 |        —        |       ✓       |       ✓       | kept |
| `PPTImageElement.softEdge`              |        —        |       ✓       |       ✓       | kept |
| `TableCellBorder` + `TableCell.borders` |        —        |       ✓       |       ✓       | kept |
| `TableCell.padding`                     |        —        |       ✓       |       ✓       | kept |
| `TableCell.vAlign`                      |        —        |  `top/middle/bottom`  | `up/mid/down/top/middle/bottom` | canonical = `top/middle/bottom`; importer already normalizes its `up/mid/down` aliases in `transformParsedToSlides` |
| `PPTTableElement.rowHeights`            |        —        |       ✓       |       ✓       | kept |
| `Slide.script` (speaker notes)          |        —        |       —       |       ✓       | kept |
| `Slide.viewportSize/viewportRatio/theme`|    required     |   required    |   optional    | canonical = **required**; importer now fills them at construction in `transformParsedToSlides` (no partial/draft stage) |
| `SlideData` (deprecated)                |        ✓        |       —       |       ✓       | kept, `@deprecated` |

The importer conforms to the canonical contract: it normalizes cell `vAlign`
aliases and emits the required `Slide` fields on output. The renderer consumes
the same superset (it gains access to `script` and the importer-origin fields it
didn't previously declare).

## Build

Pure TypeScript compiled with `tsc` to ESM + `.d.ts`, then the JSON Schema
artifacts are generated into `dist/schema/`:

```bash
pnpm --filter @openmaic/dsl build         # -> dist/ (index.js, index.d.ts, …) + dist/schema/*.json
pnpm --filter @openmaic/dsl build:schema  # regenerate only dist/schema/*.json
pnpm --filter @openmaic/dsl typecheck
pnpm --filter @openmaic/dsl test
```

## License

MIT, matching the rest of the family (`@openmaic/dsl`, `@openmaic/importer`,
`@openmaic/renderer`) and the OpenMAIC root, so the license policy is uniform
across the SDK.
