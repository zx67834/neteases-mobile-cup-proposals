/**
 * The asset-storage seam the DSL owns the *shape* of.
 *
 * Large binaries (generated images / audio / video) never live inside a DSL
 * document — a document embeds only a stable {@link AssetRef}, and a
 * {@link StorageProvider} resolves that ref to a URL at render time. The
 * indirection is what keeps a document portable: a raw URL would bake in a
 * particular provider and an expiry assumption, so it cannot travel with the
 * document to another runtime. `@openmaic/renderer` already consumes resolved
 * URLs via its media slots; the set of refs a document touches, with per-asset
 * metadata, is enumerated as its asset manifest by `./asset-manifest.ts`.
 * ZIP and video consume that enumeration; PPTX walks slide elements directly
 * while sharing the same resolver and resolution semantics. The reserved
 * future `@openmaic/exporter` package can build on the same contract.
 *
 * The DSL owns only the minimal `put` / `resolve` / `remove` interface.
 * Concrete backends — IndexedDB + object URLs in the browser, object storage /
 * CDN on a server — live in `@openmaic/storage`, keeping this package
 * dependency- and DOM-free. Implementations may offer richer registry
 * operations (for example an atomic byte replacement behind a stable ref)
 * without the DSL contract growing them.
 */

/**
 * A stable, backend-agnostic handle to a stored asset: an identifier the
 * provider **allocated** at `put` time, opaque to everyone else. A plain string
 * so it embeds cleanly in DSL documents (e.g. `PPTImageElement.src`,
 * `PPTVideoElement.mediaRef`).
 *
 * Allocated, not derived: a ref says nothing about the bytes behind it. That is
 * what lets a richer implementation regenerate or replace those bytes without
 * invalidating a single document pointing at the ref, and lets one set of
 * bytes carry several refs with different metadata. A provider may still store
 * identical bytes once internally, but that is a property of its storage
 * layer, not of the ref.
 *
 * The ref domain is unconstrained: any string may be handed to `resolve` or
 * `remove`, and a ref the provider never issued is simply one that resolves to
 * nothing.
