/**
 * DSL version + migration registry.
 *
 * The DSL version is independent of the npm package version: it identifies the
 * shape of the *serialized* slide contract so that persisted documents can be
 * migrated forward as the schema evolves. A package release can bump for
 * code/API reasons (new exports, refactors) without touching the serialized
 * shape — in which case {@link DSL_VERSION} stays put; conversely the first
 * breaking change to the on-disk shape bumps {@link DSL_VERSION} and appends a
 * migration, regardless of where the package version happens to be.
 *
 * This module owns the *mechanism*: the ordered {@link DSL_MIGRATIONS} ladder,
 * plus the pure {@link migrate} runner that walks a document from whatever
 * version it was written at up to {@link DSL_VERSION}. It carries no runtime
 * dependency, and — like every migration transform — is pure and idempotent.
 *
 * The migratable unit (a {@link Stage} aggregate, a single Scene row, or a
 * bundle of them) is deliberately left open: the runner only needs the
 * {@link DSL_VERSION_KEY} envelope field to read the current version and stamp
 * the new one. Which aggregate carries that field is decided when a normalized
 * store first consumes this pipeline.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * RELEASE RULE, ENFORCED: changing {@link DSL_VERSION} or
 * {@link RUNTIME_DSL_VERSION} requires **an increase of this package's npm
 * version that the dependents' caret range will NOT admit**.
 * `scripts/check-package-version-bumps.mjs` fails the merge if it does not.
 *
 * `@openmaic/storage`, `@openmaic/renderer` and `@openmaic/importer` depend on
 * this package as `workspace:^`, published as a caret. Anything that caret
 * admits reaches them with no release of their own, so the required increase is
 * exactly the one it does not admit:
 *
 * - while this package is `0.x`, `^0.5.1` admits `0.5.x`, so a **MINOR**;
 * - once it reaches `1.0.0`, `^1.4.2` admits minors as well, so a **MAJOR**.
 *
 * The rule is stated as "escapes the caret" rather than as a fixed level
 * because the level changes at the 1.0 boundary — a rule that said MINOR would
 * quietly stop being sufficient exactly when this package matured.
 *
 * Independence from the npm version, described above, is about which way the
 * two numbers may move *apart*: a package release may leave the format alone.
 * The reverse is constrained, for the reason just given.
 *
 * Shipping a format change inside the caret would deliver it silently. The same
 * published `storage` version, resolved against two different admitted dsl
 * versions, would write and then refuse to read the same rows — storage
 * compares these constants by value and rejects anything stamped newer than it
 * knows.

 * key, so `versionOf` reads it as {@link UNVERSIONED_DSL_VERSION} and the runner
 * would walk its own legacy ladder over it — stamping a foreign key and, once a
 * real transform lands on either ladder, mangling or throwing on the other
 * line's payload. The guard is keyed on the presence of the two stamps:
 *
 * 1. Own line's stamp present → migrate normally on this line, regardless of the
 *    other key (a doubly-stamped envelope is each runner's own line's data).
 * 2. Both stamps absent → depends on the line. A line WITH an unversioned epoch
 *    (`legacyVersion` non-null, the document line) treats it as genuine legacy
 *    data and walks its ladder from `legacyVersion`. A line with NO unversioned
 *    epoch (`legacyVersion === null`, the runtime line) **throws**
 *    {@link noRuntimeEpochError}: its envelope is brand new and stamped at write
 *    time, so an unstamped object is a misrouted legacy document or an unstamped
 *    producer write, not migratable legacy data.
 * 3. Own stamp ABSENT + other line's stamp PRESENT → **throw**. The envelope
 *    cannot say whether this is the other line's aggregate misrouted here or
 *    this line's data carrying a stray foreign stamp — walking the ladder would
 *    mangle the former, while silently returning it unchanged would permanently
 *    orphan the latter from its own line (its predicate would report "current"
 *    forever). An ambiguous envelope is corrupt data, handled like a malformed
 *    stamp: fail loud. `validateRuntimeSession` rejects a stray `dslVersion` at
 *    the door for the same reason.
