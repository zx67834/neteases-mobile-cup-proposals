/**
 * Stage / Scene / SceneContent — the universal lesson-skeleton contract.
 *
 * This module owns the *structural* part of a lesson: the top-level `Stage`
 * container and a per-page `Scene` whose `content` is a discriminated union of
 * the universal content kinds (`SlideContent`, `QuizContent`). Interactive and
 * PBL content contracts are exported alongside them and compose through
 * `Scene`'s generic content parameter. `Scene`'s
 * playback `actions` default to the contract's standard {@link Action} union
 * (defined in `./action.ts`); apps can still extend widget payloads and action
 * sets through `Scene`'s generic parameters.
 *
 * The split keeps `@openmaic/dsl` focused on the lesson skeleton while letting the
 * runtime engine, renderer, and importer share one source of truth for it.
 *
 * No runtime dependencies. Pure types + pure discriminant guards only.

 * definition, so a cross-language consumer validating against a pinned copy
 * of an older published schema artifact rejects any document that carries
 * these fields. Under strict schema validation, additive fields ARE a
 * breaking change — such consumers must upgrade their schema artifact in
 * lockstep with the documents they accept. (A `DSL_VERSION` bump would not
 * help them: an old schema rejects the new documents either way.)

 * Scene - Represents a single page/scene in the course.

 * The scene-level `type` discriminant is **bound to its `content`**: a
 * slide-typed scene must carry `SlideContent`, a quiz-typed scene `QuizContent`,
 * and so on. This is a real invariant — consumers branch on `scene.type` and
 * then read `scene.content` as the matching shape — so the contract enforces it
 * at the type level rather than leaving the two free to disagree.
 *
 * Implemented as a distributive conditional over `TContent`: the binding holds
 * per member of the content union, so the default `Scene<Action, SlideContent |
 * QuizContent>` is `({ type: 'slide'; content: SlideContent } | { type: 'quiz';
 * content: QuizContent }) & SceneCore`; consumers compose the exported
 * interactive and PBL types into `TContent`, and every member ties its own
 * `type` to its shape.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // app side — widen content; widen actions only if the app adds its own
 * type AppScene = Scene<Action, AppSceneContent>;
 * ```
 *
 * Skeleton-only consumers that reject actions entirely can still opt out with
 * `Scene<never, …>`.
