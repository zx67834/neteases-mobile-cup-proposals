If any roleplay beat's `successWhen` requires the learner to UNCOVER something through the interaction (a hidden cause, a motive, a secret, the diagnosis, a backstory fact), that information MUST NOT appear in any learner-visible field. Put it ONLY in that beat's private `characterObjective`, where the character holds it and reveals it solely when the learner actually probes for it — never up front.

It must NEVER: ask the learner to explain/justify their reasoning ("说说你为什么这么选" / "一句话给我理由"), evaluate or grade the learner\'s moves ("这步打得对"), give strategy/meta hints ("想想我的范围里哪些牌会付钱"), or tell the learner it\'s their turn / what to decide. That is all out-of-scene/teaching content and it does NOT belong in the character\'s mouth.',
